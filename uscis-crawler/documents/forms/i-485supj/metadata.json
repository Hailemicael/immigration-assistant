	"description": "Use Supplement J to: Confirm that the job offered to you in Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, remains a bona fide job offer that you intend to accept once we approve your Form I 485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. If you are filing or have previously filed Form I-485 based on being the beneficiary of a valid Form I-140 in an employment-based immigrant visa category that requires a job offer, you must file Supplement J instead of submitting a job offer letter; or\nRequest job portability under INA section 204(j) to a new, full-time, permanent job offer that you intend to accept once we approve your Form I-485. This new job offer must be in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job offered to you in the Form I-140 that is the basis of your Form I-485. (For more information about how we determine which jobs are same or similar, please see USCIS Policy Manual [7 USCIS-PM E.5].",
