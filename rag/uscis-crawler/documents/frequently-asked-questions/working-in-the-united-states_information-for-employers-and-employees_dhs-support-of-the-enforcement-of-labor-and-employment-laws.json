		"question": "Q1. What is deferred action?",
		"answer": "A1. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against an alien for a certain period of time. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, an alien granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes, while the deferred action is in effect. If granted deferred action, an alien may be eligible for employment authorization. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion."

An alien requesting deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need submits a written request for deferred action by submitting:\nThe alien will submit this request to:\nUSCISAttn: Deferred Action 10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350\nAttorneys who are submitting deferred action requests for multiple aliens should submit each individual application in its own envelope.\nUSCIS will refer to ICE any deferred action requests that fall within ICE’s authority, including requests submitted by aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal.\nAs with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests by aliens based on a labor agency investigation or need on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.\nIf deferred action is granted through this process, the initial period of deferred action and employment authorization will generally be for a period up to four years."

	{
		"question": "Q5. What agency will be reviewing requests for deferred action from alien workers?",
		"answer": "A5. Requests for deferred action made by alien workers who are participating in or otherwise necessary to a labor agency investigation should be submitted to USCIS through the central intake point specifically established to support labor agency investigative efforts for deferred action requests. USCIS will review the request, as well as the alien’s immigration history, to determine which office within DHS has authority over the request. Upon reviewing the submission for completeness, USCIS will only forward to ICE requests for deferred action that are submitted by aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal. USCIS and ICE, as appropriate, will consider and make a case-by-case determination of the deferred action request, and USCIS will consider all related Forms I-765, if submitted."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q6. Will aliens who apply for deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need through this process be referred to ICE for enforcement action?",
		"answer": "A6. Through the centralized intake process, USCIS will forward to ICE only those requests for deferred action from aliens who are in removal proceedings already or who have a final order of removal, so that ICE can consider the request for deferred action. All other requests will be processed by USCIS. Consistent with all USCIS adjudications, USCIS generally will not refer cases to ICE post-decision absent national security public safety, and border security concerns."

		"question": "Q7. If deferred action is granted through this process, when does it end?",
		"answer": "A7. If deferred action is approved, it may be granted generally for an initial period of up to four years, subject to termination at any time. The recipient may also be eligible to submit a subsequent request for deferred action (see question 15 below), which will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis when a labor agency provides a basis for such a request as it relates to the labor agency’s ongoing investigative or enforcement interests. Subsequent requests if granted, based on a labor agency investigation or need, will generally be for an additional period up to two years."

		"question": "Q9. Can an alien currently present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process?",
		"answer": "A9. Yes. An alien worker who is present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) and who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation can request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process. The worker should indicate in their written request for deferred action their current immigration status and the expiration date of that status, while also providing a copy of their Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, reflecting that status. This will facilitate timely processing of the deferred action request and minimize the risk of gaps in employment authorization or accrual of unlawful presence."

Individuals granted deferred action may be eligible for employment authorization under existing regulations at 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14), which require them to demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Aliens submitting a deferred action request may request employment authorization concurrently utilizing Part 3 of Form G-325A and submitting the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If DHS grants deferred action, we will then adjudicate the Employment Authorization Request. Note that if DHS does not grant deferred action, we will not refund or return the Form I-765 fee.

		"question": "Q23. Can DHS terminate an alien’s deferred action before it expires?",
		"answer": "A23. Yes. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and we may terminate a grant of deferred action at any time in DHS’s discretion. Prior to terminating a grant of deferred action, DHS will generally provide a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) and, if a NOIT is issued, will generally allow the requestor 60 days to respond and an opportunity to provide updated information about the individual request and surrounding circumstances before terminating a deferred action grant. If DHS terminates the grant of deferred action, DHS intends to provide the individual with notice of the termination. DHS retains prosecutorial discretion, and in the exercise of that discretion may take into account the circumstances that led to the initial grant of deferred action and any subsequent developments, notwithstanding the termination of deferred action under this process.\nMultiple mechanisms in our immigration laws can provide employment authorization to alien workers and protect them from removal, including discretionary relief such as deferred action or parole in place and other forms of relief such as T and U nonimmigrant visas. There are also circumstances where a labor or employment agency may request expedited processing of an alien’s pending application, petition, or request.\nA.

Subsequent Requests for Deferred Action:\nAn alien granted deferred action based on a labor agency enforcement interest may request a subsequent period of deferred action for an additional two years when there continues to be an ongoing labor agency need. Subsequent requests must be accompanied by an updated Statement of Interest from the labor agency explaining the continued need for workers to assist in their investigation or prosecution, or in the enforcement of any court order or settlement agreement. The updated Statement of Interest must include the required details listed above, and also describe the scope of workers who are in need of continued protection based on the procedural posture of the labor agency’s investigation, prosecution, or enforcement actions.\nDeferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an alien for a certain period of time.

		"answer": "A21. No. If an alien requested and were granted a subsequent period of deferred action, they have already obtained an initial two-year period and a subsequent two-year period for a total of four years. If there is a labor agency need beyond the four-year period of deferred action that the alien has already obtained, the labor agency may issue a new Statement of Interest and the alien may request another subsequent period of deferred action on that basis."

		"question": "Q23. Can DHS terminate an alien’s deferred action before it expires?",
		"answer": "A23. Yes. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and we may terminate a grant of deferred action at any time in DHS’s discretion. Prior to terminating a grant of deferred action, DHS will generally provide a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) and, if a NOIT is issued, will generally allow the requestor 60 days to respond and an opportunity to provide updated information about the individual request and surrounding circumstances before terminating a deferred action grant. If DHS terminates the grant of deferred action, DHS intends to provide the individual with notice of the termination. DHS retains prosecutorial discretion, and in the exercise of that discretion may take into account the circumstances that led to the initial grant of deferred action and any subsequent developments, notwithstanding the termination of deferred action under this process.\nMultiple mechanisms in our immigration laws can provide employment authorization to alien workers and protect them from removal, including discretionary relief such as deferred action or parole in place and other forms of relief such as T and U nonimmigrant visas. There are also circumstances where a labor or employment agency may request expedited processing of an alien’s pending application, petition, or request.\nA. Initial Requests for Deferred Action:\nLabor and employment agencies can seek DHS support in an ongoing investigation or enforcement action by providing workers with a Statement of Interest that must be included as part of the alien’s request for deferred action. The Statement of Interest must:\nLabor agencies which are drafting a Statement of Interest for the first time or which have questions about the process are encouraged to seek technical assistance prior to submission. To request such assistance, please contact CRCLImmigration@hq.dhs.gov.\nB. Subsequent Requests for Deferred Action:\nAn alien granted deferred action based on a labor agency enforcement interest may request a subsequent period of deferred action for an additional two years when there continues to be an ongoing labor agency need. Subsequent requests must be accompanied by an updated Statement of Interest from the labor agency explaining the continued need for workers to assist in their investigation or prosecution, or in the enforcement of any court order or settlement agreement. The updated Statement of Interest must include the required details listed above, and also describe the scope of workers who are in need of continued protection based on the procedural posture of the labor agency’s investigation, prosecution, or enforcement actions.\nDeferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an alien for a certain period of time. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, an alien granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes while the deferred action is in effect. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.\nUnder existing regulations, an alien granted deferred action may apply for and obtain employment authorization for the period of deferred action if they demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.”\nAlien workers who fall within the scope of a labor agency investigation can submit their requests for deferred action to USCIS through a central intake point specifically established to handle requests for deferred action related to labor agency investigative efforts. USCIS will forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) any requests for deferred action from aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal, so ICE can consider the request for deferred action.\nAs with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests based on a labor agency investigation on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.\nInitial Requests:\nTo request deferred action under this centralized intake process, alien requestors must submit the following:\nIf deferred action is granted through this process, the period of deferred action and employment authorization will generally be for a period up to four years.\nAttorneys who are submitting deferred action requests for multiple aliens should submit each individual request in its own, separate envelope.\nSubmit all of these materials to:\nUSCISAttn: Deferred Action – Labor Investigations10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350\nSubsequent Requests:\nTo submit a subsequent request for deferred action for an additional period of up to two years based on a labor agency investigation or need, alien requestors must submit the following:\nSubsequent requests, if granted, will generally be for an additional period of up to two years.\nSubmit all of these materials to:\nUSCISAttn: Deferred Action 10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350\nReplacement Employment Authorization Documents:"

Requests for deferred action made by alien workers who are participating in or otherwise necessary to a labor agency investigation should be submitted to USCIS through the central intake point specifically established to support labor agency investigative efforts for deferred action requests. USCIS will review the request, as well as the alien’s immigration history, to determine which office within DHS has authority over the request. Upon reviewing the submission for completeness, USCIS will only forward to ICE requests for deferred action that are submitted by aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal. USCIS and ICE, as appropriate, will consider and make a case-by-case determination of the deferred action request, and USCIS will consider all related Forms I-765, if submitted."

		"question": "Q6. Will aliens who apply for deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need through this process be referred to ICE for enforcement action?",
		"answer": "A6. Through the centralized intake process, USCIS will forward to ICE only those requests for deferred action from aliens who are in removal proceedings already or who have a final order of removal, so that ICE can consider the request for deferred action. All other requests will be processed by USCIS. Consistent with all USCIS adjudications, USCIS generally will not refer cases to ICE post-decision absent national security public safety, and border security concerns."

		"question": "Q7. If deferred action is granted through this process, when does it end?",
		"answer": "A7. If deferred action is approved, it may be granted generally for an initial period of up to four years, subject to termination at any time. The recipient may also be eligible to submit a subsequent request for deferred action (see question 15 below), which will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis when a labor agency provides a basis for such a request as it relates to the labor agency’s ongoing investigative or enforcement interests. Subsequent requests if granted, based on a labor agency investigation or need, will generally be for an additional period up to two years."

		"answer": "A9. Yes. An alien worker who is present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) and who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation can request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process. The worker should indicate in their written request for deferred action their current immigration status and the expiration date of that status, while also providing a copy of their Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, reflecting that status. This will facilitate timely processing of the deferred action request and minimize the risk of gaps in employment authorization or accrual of unlawful presence."

Individuals granted deferred action may be eligible for employment authorization under existing regulations at 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14), which require them to demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Aliens submitting a deferred action request may request employment authorization concurrently utilizing Part 3 of Form G-325A and submitting the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If DHS grants deferred action, we will then adjudicate the Employment Authorization Request. Note that if DHS does not grant deferred action, we will not refund or return the Form I-765 fee. If the requestor does not want to request employment authorization with their deferred action request, they can send their Form G-325A without selecting Part 3, Employment Authorization."

A labor agency that has a continued need for workers to help in their investigation or prosecution of a case, or any related enforcement action, may support an alien’s subsequent request for deferred action by providing the alien with an updated Statement of Interest. The labor agency should make an assessment of the continuing need for worker participation and should reassess the scope of workers in need of protection based on the phase of the agency’s enforcement effort at that time.\nLabor agencies must provide workers with this updated Statement of Interest, which must be included as part of the alien’s subsequent request for deferred action."
