		"answer": "For Labor Agencies Submitting a Statement of Interest FormMultiple mechanisms in our immigration laws can provide employment authorization to alien workers and protect them from removal, including discretionary relief such as deferred action or parole in place and other forms of relief such as T and U nonimmigrant visas. There are also circumstances where a labor or employment agency may request expedited processing of an alien’s pending application, petition, or request.A. Initial Requests for Deferred Action:Labor and employment agencies can seek DHS support in an ongoing investigation or enforcement action by providing workers with a Statement of Interest that must be included as part of the alien’s request for deferred action. The Statement of Interest must:Be addressed to the Department of Homeland Security;Detail the nature of the labor or employment agency’s investigation or enforcement action and the need for DHS support;Describe the agency’s enforcement interests that provide the basis for their request;Describe the worksite and the workers who may be helpful with the agency investigation or enforcement action; andProvide an agency point of contact who can address follow up questions from DHS.Labor agencies which are drafting a Statement of Interest for the first time or which have questions about the process are encouraged to seek technical assistance prior to submission. To request such assistance, please contact CRCLImmigration@hq.dhs.gov.B. Subsequent Requests for Deferred Action:An alien granted deferred action based on a labor agency enforcement interest may request a subsequent period of deferred action for an additional two years when there continues to be an ongoing labor agency need. Subsequent requests must be accompanied by an updated Statement of Interest from the labor agency explaining the continued need for workers to assist in their investigation or prosecution, or in the enforcement of any court order or settlement agreement. The updated Statement of Interest must include the required details listed above, and also describe the scope of workers who are in need of continued protection based on the procedural posture of the labor agency’s investigation, prosecution, or enforcement actions.Process for Aliens Requesting Deferred ActionDeferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an alien for a certain period of time. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, an alien granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes while the deferred action is in effect. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.Under existing regulations, an alien granted deferred action may apply for and obtain employment authorization for the period of deferred action if they demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.”Alien workers who fall within the scope of a labor agency investigation can submit their requests for deferred action to USCIS through a central intake point specifically established to handle requests for deferred action related to labor agency investigative efforts. USCIS will forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) any requests for deferred action from aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal, so ICE can consider the request for deferred action.As with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests based on a labor agency investigation on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.Initial Requests:To request deferred action under this centralized intake process, alien requestors must submit the following:Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);A Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;Evidence to establish that the alien falls within the scope of workers specified in the Statement of Interest, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, and/or other documentary evidence such as a signed affidavit to demonstrate that the alien was employed during the period identified in the labor or employment agency statement;Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;Proof of the alien’s identity and nationality;If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the United States or other evidence relating to the alien’s immigration history or status; andFor individuals requesting Employment Authorization through Part 3 of Form G-325A, submit the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If an alien is unable to pay the Form I-765 filing fee, they may request the fee be waived by filing  Form I-912, Request for a Fee Waiver. Additional information is available on the fee waiver page.If deferred action is granted through this process, the period of deferred action and employment authorization will generally be for a period up to four years.Attorneys who are submitting deferred action requests for multiple aliens should submit each individual request in its own, separate envelope.Submit all of these materials to:USCISAttn: Deferred Action – Labor Investigations10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350Subsequent Requests:To submit a subsequent request for deferred action for an additional period of up to two years based on a labor agency investigation or need, alien requestors must submit the following:Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);An updated Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;Evidence to establish that the alien falls within the scope identified in the Statement of Interest, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, and/or other documentary evidence such as a signed affidavit to demonstrate that the alien was employed during the period specified in the labor or employment agency statement;Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion, which may include evidence of the alien’s past participation or willingness to actively participate in the labor agency investigation;Proof of the alien’s identity and nationality;If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the United States or other evidence relating to the alien’s immigration history or status; andFor individuals requesting Employment Authorization through Part 3 of Form G-325A, submit the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If an alien is unable to pay the Form I-765 filing fee, they may request the fee be waived by filing Form I-912, Request for a Fee Waiver. Additional information is available on the fee waiver page.Subsequent requests, if granted, will generally be for an additional period of up to two years.Submit all of these materials to:USCISAttn: Deferred Action 10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350Replacement Employment Authorization Documents:To request a replacement EAD due to the EAD being lost, stolen or damaged, please see the “Deferred Action” section on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization page to submit Form I-765 and applicable fees.To request a replacement EAD due to an error on the card, please see the “Replacement for Card Error” section on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization page. There is separate guidance for:If an alien needs to replace a card USCIS issued because it contains incorrect information that is not due to a USCIS error.If an alien needs to replace a card USCIS issued because it contains incorrect information that is due to a USCIS error.FAQsQ1. What is deferred action?A1. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against an alien for a certain period of time. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, an alien granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes, while the deferred action is in effect. If granted deferred action, an alien may be eligible for employment authorization. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.Q2. How can a labor agency find out more about this process?A2. Labor agency representatives can contact CRCLImmigration@hq.dhs.gov to learn more about this process and request technical assistance.Q3. How does a labor agency support an alien’s request for deferred action?A3. Labor and employment agencies can seek DHS support in an ongoing investigation or enforcement action by providing workers with a Statement of Interest that must be included as part of the alien’s request for deferred action. The Statement of Interest must:Be addressed to the Department of Homeland Security;Detail the nature of the labor or employment agency’s investigation or enforcement action and the need for DHS support;Describe the agency’s enforcement interests that provide the basis for their request;Describe the worksite and the workers who may be helpful with the agency investigation or enforcement action; andProvide an agency point of contact who can address follow up questions from DHS.Labor agencies which are submitting a Statement of Interest for the first time or which have questions about the process are encouraged to seek technical assistance prior to submission. To request such assistance, please contact CRCLImmigration@hq.dhs.gov.Q4. How does the centralized deferred action process work?A4. An alien requesting deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need submits a written request for deferred action by submitting:Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);A Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;Evidence to establish that the worker falls within the category of workers identified in the Statement of Interest, such as W-2s, pay stubs, timecards, and/or other documentary evidence such as a signed affidavit to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period specified in the labor or employment agency statement;Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;Proof of the alien’s identity and nationality;If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the U.S. or other evidence relating to the alien’s immigration history or status;For individuals requesting Employment Authorization through Part 3 of Form G-325A, submit the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If an alien is unable to pay the Form I-765 filing fee, they may request the fee be waived by filing Form I-912, Request for a Fee Waiver. Additional information is available on the fee waiver page; andForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, if applicable.The alien will submit this request to:USCISAttn: Deferred Action 10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350Attorneys who are submitting deferred action requests for multiple aliens should submit each individual application in its own envelope.USCIS will refer to ICE any deferred action requests that fall within ICE’s authority, including requests submitted by aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal.As with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests by aliens based on a labor agency investigation or need on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.If deferred action is granted through this process, the initial period of deferred action and employment authorization will generally be for a period up to four years.Q5. What agency will be reviewing requests for deferred action from alien workers?A5. Requests for deferred action made by alien workers who are participating in or otherwise necessary to a labor agency investigation should be submitted to USCIS through the central intake point specifically established to support labor agency investigative efforts for deferred action requests. USCIS will review the request, as well as the alien’s immigration history, to determine which office within DHS has authority over the request. Upon reviewing the submission for completeness, USCIS will only forward to ICE requests for deferred action that are submitted by aliens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal. USCIS and ICE, as appropriate, will consider and make a case-by-case determination of the deferred action request, and USCIS will consider all related Forms I-765, if submitted.Q6. Will aliens who apply for deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need through this process be referred to ICE for enforcement action?A6. Through the centralized intake process, USCIS will forward to ICE only those requests for deferred action from aliens who are in removal proceedings already or who have a final order of removal, so that ICE can consider the request for deferred action. All other requests will be processed by USCIS. Consistent with all USCIS adjudications, USCIS generally will not refer cases to ICE post-decision absent national security public safety, and border security concerns.Q7. If deferred action is granted through this process, when does it end?A7. If deferred action is approved, it may be granted generally for an initial period of up to four years, subject to termination at any time. The recipient may also be eligible to submit a subsequent request for deferred action (see question 15 below), which will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis when a labor agency provides a basis for such a request as it relates to the labor agency’s ongoing investigative or enforcement interests. Subsequent requests if granted, based on a labor agency investigation or need, will generally be for an additional period up to two years.Q8. Can a alien worker who would otherwise fit within the scope of a labor-related request for prosecutorial discretion described in this FAQ but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, request deferred action?A8. Yes. An alien worker who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may request deferred action by submitting Form G-325A without selecting Employment Authorization in Part 3.Q9. Can an alien currently present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process?  A9. Yes. An alien worker who is present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) and who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation can request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process. The worker should indicate in their written request for deferred action their current immigration status and the expiration date of that status, while also providing a copy of their Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, reflecting that status. This will facilitate timely processing of the deferred action request and minimize the risk of gaps in employment authorization or accrual of unlawful presence.Q10. May an alien granted deferred action be eligible for employment authorization?A10. Individuals granted deferred action may be eligible for employment authorization under existing regulations at 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14), which require them to demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Aliens submitting a deferred action request may request employment authorization concurrently utilizing Part 3 of Form G-325A and submitting the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If DHS grants deferred action, we will then adjudicate the Employment Authorization Request. Note that if DHS does not grant deferred action, we will not refund or return the Form I-765 fee. If the requestor does not want to request employment authorization with their deferred action request, they can send their Form G-325A without selecting Part 3, Employment Authorization.Q11. Will an alien receive a Social Security Number?A11. An alien may request a Social Security number (SSN) through Part 4 of Form G-325A.  If USCIS approves the alien’s request for work authorization and the alien completed the section on the application to request a Social Security  card, then USCIS will send the Social Security Administration (SSA) the data needed to issue the alien a Social Security card.The alien will receive two documents – their Employment Authorization Document (EAD), also known as the “USCIS I-766 card” or “work permit”, and in another envelope their Social Security card. The SSA will mail the Social Security card to the address the alien listed on their I-765 application. The alien should receive their Social Security card no later than 7 business days after they receive their EAD from USCIS.If an alien does not receive their Social Security card within 7 business days after receiving their EAD, they should call or visit an SSA office. For more information, please review this flyer.Q12. Can an alien initially granted a two year period of deferred action and related employment authorization request an increase of the initial grant period from two to four years?A12. Yes. To request that the initial period of deferred action and related employment authorization be increased from two to four years, an alien should submit the following to the address listed in Question 4 above:Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action). Please write “Labor DA Extension” on the top portion of the form.Proof of the alien’s identity and nationality;The Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency that supported the initial deferred action request;A copy of the approval notice from the initial deferred action request; andFor individuals requesting Employment Authorization through Part 3 of Form G-325A, submit the appropriate Employment Authorization fee. If an alien is unable to pay the Form I-765 filing fee, they may request the fee be waived by filing Form I-912, Request for a Fee Waiver. Additional information is available on the fee waiver page.If granted, the period of deferred action, and related employment authorization, will generally be up to a total of four years from the date of the initial grant of deferred action.Q13. An alien was initially granted deferred action for a period of two years. If the alien submits a request to increase their initial deferred action time period from two years to four years, are they required to replace their employment authorization card to reflect a total of four years of validity? A13. Yes.  Extending the initial authorized period of deferred action from two years to four years does not automatically extend the validity period of employment authorization. To remain employment authorized for the duration of their deferred action, an alien must request Employment Authorization using Part 3 of Form G-325A and pay the appropriate Employment Authorization fee.Q14. How does an alien submit a request for a replacement Employment Authorization Document (EAD)?A14.A. To request a replacement EAD due to the EAD being lost, stolen or damaged, please see the “Deferred Action” section on https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses to submit Form I-765 and applicable fees.B. To request a replacement EAD due to an error on the card, please see the “Replacement for Card Error” section on: https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses. There is separate guidance for:If an alien needs to replace a card USCIS issued because it contains incorrect information that is not due to a USCIS error.If an alien needs to replace a card USCIS issued because it contains incorrect information that is due to a USCIS error.Q15. Can an alien request subsequent periods of deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need?A15. Yes. An alien granted deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need may request an additional two-year period of deferred action when there continues to be a labor agency need. Subsequent requests for deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need must be accompanied by an updated labor agency Statement of Interest explaining the continued labor agency need. The Statement of Interest must also describe the scope of workers who are in need of protection based on the procedural posture of the labor agency’s investigation, prosecution, or enforcement action.Q16. How can a labor agency support a subsequent request for deferred action?A16. A labor agency that has a continued need for workers to help in their investigation or prosecution of a case, or any related enforcement action, may support an alien’s subsequent request for deferred action by providing the alien with an updated Statement of Interest. The labor agency should make an assessment of the continuing need for worker participation and should reassess the scope of workers in need of protection based on the phase of the agency’s enforcement effort at that time.Labor agencies must provide workers with this updated Statement of Interest, which must be included as part of the alien’s subsequent request for deferred action.Q17. How does an alien request a subsequent period of deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need?A17. An alien requesting a subsequent period of deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need must submit:Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);A Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;Evidence to establish that the worker falls within the scope specified in the Statement of Interest, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, and/or other documentary evidence including a signed affidavit to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period identified in the labor or employment agency statementEvidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion, which may include evidence of the worker’s past participation or willingness to actively participate in the labor agency investigation;Proof of the alien’s identity and nationality;If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the United States and/or other evidence relating to the alien’s immigration history or status; andFor individuals requesting Employment Authorization through Part 3 of Form G-325A, submit the appropriate Employment Authorization fee.

DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant a subsequent period of deferred action. If granted, the subsequent period of deferred action will generally be for a period of up to 2 years, subject to termination at any time at the discretion of DHS.Q18. When can an alien submit their subsequent request for deferred action?A18. Aliens should submit any subsequent request for deferred action to DHS at least 120 days but no more than 180 days prior to the expiration of the current period of deferred action. Before submitting a subsequent request for deferred action, aliens should obtain an updated Statement of Interest from the labor agency and include the updated Statement of Interest with the subsequent request for deferred action to DHS.Please note that if a subsequent request for deferred action is received by DHS with less than 120 days remaining in the current period of deferred action, there could be a gap between periods of deferred action and related employment authorization.Q19. If an alien’s request for a subsequent period of deferred action is granted, when will the new period of deferred action begin?A19.If an alien submits a request for a subsequent period of deferred action to DHS at least 120 days before and no more than 180 days prior to the expiration of their current period of deferred action and the request is granted, the alien will generally receive deferred action and employment authorization for a period of up to 2 years starting from the expiration date of the current period of deferred action.If an alien submits a request for a subsequent period of deferred action less than 120 days prior to the expiration of their current period of deferred action and the request is granted, there may be a gap between periods of deferred action and related employment authorization.If an alien submits a request for a subsequent period of deferred action after the expiration date of their current period of deferred action and the subsequent request is granted, the alien will have a lapse in the duration of their deferred action period and related employment authorization. In such instances, the alien will generally receive deferred action and employment authorization for a period of up to 2 years from the grant date of the new request.Q20. How do I withdraw my pending request for labor investigation-based deferred action and employment authorization?A20. To withdraw a pending request for labor investigation-based deferred action and employment authorization, an alien must submit a written withdrawal request with their name, signature, A#, and the receipt number listed on their Form I-797C, Notice of Action. The written withdrawal request should indicate that the alien is are withdrawing their request for deferred action and employment authorization.Withdrawal requests should be submitted to:USCISAttn: Deferred Action – Labor Investigations – Withdrawal10 Application WayMontclair, CA 91763-1350Please note that if an alien withdraws their pending request, they will not receive a refund of any fees paid for their application for employment authorization. All withdrawals are final and may not be retracted. However, withdrawing a pending request will not bar the alien from requesting deferred action in the future.Q21. If an alien was granted a two-year subsequent period of deferred action, can they request that the period be increased to four years?A21. No. If an alien requested and were granted a subsequent period of deferred action, they have already obtained an initial two-year period and a subsequent two-year period for a total of four years. If there is a labor agency need beyond the four-year period of deferred action that the alien has already obtained, the labor agency may issue a new Statement of Interest and the alien may request another subsequent period of deferred action on that basis.Q22. What other immigration benefits can an alien worker pursue if they are not granted deferred action?A22. An alien worker who is the victim of a crime or subject to exploitation by an unscrupulous employer and cooperating in a labor agency investigation may be eligible for other forms of immigration relief beyond deferred action, including eligibility for a T or U nonimmigrant visa or parole in place.Q23. Can DHS terminate an alien’s deferred action before it expires?A23. Yes. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and we may terminate a grant of deferred action at any time in DHS’s discretion. Prior to terminating a grant of deferred action, DHS will generally provide a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) and, if a NOIT is issued, will generally allow the requestor 60 days to respond and an opportunity to provide updated information about the individual request and surrounding circumstances before terminating a deferred action grant. If DHS terminates the grant of deferred action, DHS intends to provide the individual with notice of the termination. DHS retains prosecutorial discretion, and in the exercise of that discretion may take into account the circumstances that led to the initial grant of deferred action and any subsequent developments, notwithstanding the termination of deferred action under this process."
