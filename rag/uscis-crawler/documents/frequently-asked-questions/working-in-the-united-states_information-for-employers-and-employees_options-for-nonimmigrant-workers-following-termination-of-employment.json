		"answer": "The grace period also provides time for certain spouses of nonimmigrant workers to continue their own employment if they have an Employment Authorization Document or are employment-authorized incident to status.\nWithin the grace period, eligible H-1B nonimmigrant workers may also begin employment again as soon as a new employer properly files a new H-1B petition, rather than waiting for the new petition to be approved. A worker filing for employment in another classification must wait to begin employment until the new petition is approved, but given the availability of premium processing, the wait for petition adjudication is often less than 15 business days."

For H-1B and O workers who chose to depart the United States after involuntary cessation of employment, the H-1B employer or the O employer and O petitioner, as applicable, must pay the reasonable costs of transportation to the worker’s last place of foreign residence. In addition, for O workers, both the employer and the petitioner are jointly and severally liable for the reasonable cost of return transportation.

Those seeking another classification for which they may be eligible can complete the application or petition process abroad and seek readmission to the United States.\nRegulations permit a discretionary grace period that allows workers in E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, or TN classifications (and their dependents) to be considered as having maintained status in that same classification after the end of employment for up to 60 consecutive calendar days or until the end of the authorized nonimmigrant validity period, whichever is shorter (the “maximum 60-day grace period”).

		"question": "Q: If I find a new H-1B employer, can my new employer file the new H-1B petition without a certified Labor Condition Application (LCA)?",
		"answer": "The timely filing of a non-frivolous application to change status will “toll,” or stop, the accrual of unlawful presence until the application is adjudicated, if the applicant did not work without authorization, either before the application was filed or while it was pending, and the applicant maintained their status prior to the filing of the request for change of status.\nFor example, if an individual files a non-frivolous application to change status before the end of the applicant’s maximum 60-day grace period, they will not accrue unlawful presence while the application remains pending, even after the maximum 60-day grace period has elapsed (again, as long as they did not work without authorization either before the application was filed or while it was pending). If the application is ultimately approved, then the individual’s status is changed, and the individual is considered to have been in a period of authorized stay for the entire time the application was pending.  If the application is denied, then the individual starts to accrue unlawful presence the day after the denial decision. Please see our Unlawful Presence and Inadmissibility page for more information.\nWorkers may use the maximum 60-day grace period to apply to change their nonimmigrant status, which, depending on eligibility, may include:"

		"answer": "Some workers may be eligible to file a self-petitioned immigrant visa petition concurrently with an adjustment of status application. Examples of immigrant classifications that are eligible for self-petitioning include EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and EB-5 Immigrant Investor. Workers with a pending adjustment application are generally eligible to remain in the United States in a period of authorized stay and obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\nWorkers who are the beneficiary of an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) may be eligible for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD) for up to one year if they:\nA compelling circumstances EAD is a discretionary stopgap measure intended to assist certain individuals on the path to lawful permanent resident status by preventing the need to abruptly leave the United States. Workers who begin employment on a compelling circumstances EAD will no longer be maintaining nonimmigrant status but generally will be in a period of authorized stay and will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid. More information about eligibility requirements and the application process can be found on our Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances page."

		"answer": "Some circumstances may warrant expedited adjudication, including applications to change status to a dependent status that includes eligibility for employment authorization. For example, an application to change status from H-1B to L-2 may be eligible for expedited adjudication to prevent severe financial loss. See the How to Make an Expedite Request page for additional information. Please note that USCIS generally does not consider expedite requests for petitions and applications if premium processing service is available.\nNotwithstanding the above options to extend a period of authorized stay, workers may choose to depart the United States. For H-1B and O workers who chose to depart the United States after involuntary cessation of employment, the H-1B employer or the O employer and O petitioner, as applicable, must pay the reasonable costs of transportation to the worker’s last place of foreign residence. In addition, for O workers, both the employer and the petitioner are jointly and severally liable for the reasonable cost of return transportation. (See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(E) and 8 CFR 214.2(o)(16).)\nOnce abroad, H-1B holders may seek U.S. employment and readmission to the United States for any remaining period of their H-1B status. Those seeking another classification for which they may be eligible can complete the application or petition process abroad and seek readmission to the United States."
