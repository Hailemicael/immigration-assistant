		"answer": "Case-by-Case Extension of Initial ParoleQ1. I am still waiting for USCIS to process my asylum application. Do I need to file for re-parole through the new streamlined application process before my initial parole period expires?A. If you are an Afghan national who entered the United States on or after July 31, 2021, with an OAR or PAR Class of Admission (COA), and you have a pending asylum or adjustment of status application, we will consider you, on a case-by-case basis, for an extension of initial parole and employment authorization for up to 2 years.This case-by-case extension of initial parole applies to Afghan nationals who:Have an OAR or PAR COA;Have a pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, or Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, including derivatives on a principal’s asylum application; andApply for asylum or adjustment of status before their initial parole expires.If we extend your initial parole period:We will send you a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, indicating that we have extended your initial period of parole and, where applicable, your Employment Authorization Document (EAD), for up to 2 years. It’s important to note that, because you are employment authorized incident to parole, if we extend your initial period of parole you can continue to legally work in the United States. You can present an employer your facially expired c11 Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and your Form I-797C extending the EAD as proof of identity and employment authorization for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification.Note: If you experience an issue with your employer verifying your employment eligibility because they rejected your facially expired c11 EAD and Form I-797C that extends your EAD, please visit the Department of Justice’s Immigrant and Employee Rights page or call their Worker Hotline at 800-255-7688.When we extend your initial period of parole, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will update your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, to show the date of your extended period of parole.If you want an updated EAD, or if you never had an EAD based on your initial parole or have lost your parole-based EAD, you may submit Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, online or on paper using category c11. We will exempt the fee to process your Form I-765 as part of this parole extension process. You must include with your filing a copy of your Form I-797C extending your initial parole period and initial EAD.Please note that if an alien is eligible to be considered for extension of initial parole but also files a request for re-parole under the new streamlined application process, USCIS will generally prioritize consideration of extending the initial period of parole. If we approve the extension, we will administratively close the Form I-131 filed for re-parole under the streamlined.Q2. USCIS notified me of my parole extension. Do I need to request a new EAD?A. No. For parole extensions, your facially expired c11 EAD, and the Form I-797C that extends your EAD, are proof of identity and employment authorization that you can show your employer for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. However, if you want an updated EAD or if you never had an EAD based on your initial parole, you may submit Form I-765 to USCIS, online or on paper, using category c11. We will exempt the fee to process your Form I-765 as part of this parole extension process, however you must include with your filing a copy of your Form I-797C extending your parole and initial EAD. For instructions on how to apply for an EAD online or on paper, visit uscis.gov/allieswelcome and find information under the ‘Afghan National Parolees – Information About Employment Authorization’ section.Q3. Can my employer require me to present an EAD if USCIS extended my initial parole?A. No. Your employer is not permitted to request any specific document for Form I-9. That could be unlawful discrimination. Your facially expired c11 EAD, in combination with your Form I-797C extending your EAD, is unexpired proof of identity and employment authorization for your employer for Form I-9. You can find out more information about your rights as an employee and report possible discrimination by visiting the Department of Justice’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section page.Q4. Is USCIS automatically extending my parole period if I have a pending application for asylum (Form I-589) or for a Green Card (Form I-485)?A. We are considering, on a case-by-case basis, an extension of initial parole for all Afghan nationals who entered the United States on or after July 31, 2021, with an OAR or PAR class of admission who have a pending Form I-589 or Form I-485. You do not need to notify us of your pending application or file a request for an extension of your initial parole. We will identify all Afghan parolees who meet these criteria who have a pending asylum or adjustment of status application and review them case-by-case for parole extension.Q5. Will USCIS let me know when you will start to review my initial parole for a possible case-by-case extension for up to 2 years?A. No. However, we will contact you on an individual basis if we approve your extension by issuing a Form I-797C notice, extending your initial parole period and EAD. Our goal is to grant parole extensions to those who are eligible as quickly and efficiently as possible.Q6. I believe I am eligible for an extension of my initial parole period because I have a pending asylum application, but I have not received any communication from USCIS about the extension. My initial period of parole will expire soon. Do I need to file for re-parole by submitting Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, under the streamlined application process?A. If you have a pending Form I-589 or I-485, we will consider you for an extension of parole and you do not need to file a request for re-parole. We are monitoring parole expiration dates and we will prioritize extensions considering those dates.Q7. How soon will USCIS start to send out Form I-797C notices informing Afghan parolees of their case-by-case extension of initial parole?A. We began issuing the first notices in July 2023. On a recurring basis, we are identifying individuals who filed Form I-589 and Form I-485 to determine eligibility for extension of their initial period of parole. Please remember, if you have moved, even to a temporary location, you must update your mailing and physical address with USCIS within 10 days of moving. You may update your address in your USCIS online account or by using our Change of Address tool at uscis.gov/addresschange (please include all of the receipt numbers associated with your pending applications with USCIS on the form). This will enable us to send notices to your current address.Q8. Will you consider dependents on an eligible principal asylum application for the case-by-case extension of initial parole?A. Yes. We will adjudicate a principal asylum applicant’s children and spouse’s asylum case , as well as consider them for extension of parole, as announced on June 8, 2023, based on the principal’s asylum application.Please note that individuals, including minor children, who wish to apply for a Green Card must submit their own Form I-485. Q9. I have filed a Form I-485 as a special immigrant, but I have not received my receipt number. How will you consider the extension of my initial parole in this case?A. We will only consider extension of parole when an individual has a pending Form I-485 or Form I-589. There are a variety of reasons why you may not have received a receipt number, including but not limited to:We did not receive your application;We received your application but have not yet processed it;We issued the receipt notice and it is still in the mail; orWe rejected your application.If you filed online, you may check the status of your application through your USCIS online account.Q10. I have a pending application for a Green Card under a family-based petition. Will USCIS review and consider my initial parole for an extension while I wait for you to complete processing my Green Card application?A. Yes. On a case-by-case basis, DHS will consider eligible Afghan nationals with a pending Green Card application for an extension of their initial period of parole for up to 2 more years.Q11. If my client filed for asylum or for a Green Card, pro se, can I file a Form G-28 to receive information and correspondence about the status of a client’s parole extension?A. Yes. An attorney or accredited representative would have to file a Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, for each form type they are inquiring about. We cannot transfer the information on a Form G-28 that is associated with a pending Form I-485 or Form I-589 to the Form I-765.Q12. If another attorney helped file an asylum or Green Card application for an Afghan parolee, but I want to help ensure they get their extension of parole, can I file a Form G-28 for them and get information about the status of their extension of parole, while their attorney for the asylum or Green Card application receives information about these filings?A. Yes. You would need to file a Form G-28 for a previously adjudicated Form I-765, where applicable, for your client to receive information about the status of their parole extension.Q13. How can I check the status of my parole extension and notice?A. The table below explains how to ask about your case if you are an Afghan parolee:Who has not received a Form I-797C notice extending your parole;Who has a pending Form I-589 or Form I-485; andWhose initial period of parole will expire in the next 14 calendar days.If youThenFiled either Form I-589 or Form I-765 through your USCIS online accountYou may send us a secure message from your USCIS online account to inquire about the extension of your parole. Through the account, you will also have access to all of the account features, such as the ability to view notices, respond to Requests for Evidence, and check case status.Submitted a paper form to USCIS and your receipt number begins with IOEWe mailed you an Account Acceptance Notice about creating a USCIS online account. The letter has an Online Access Code that is valid for 90 days to help you create an account. If your Online Acceptance Code has expired, you may still link your paper-filed form to your USCIS online account. During this process, the system will give you the option to request a new code, which we will mail to your address of record.Creating a USCIS online account allows you to receive automatic case alerts by email or text, check case status, see processing times, upload evidence, update your address, and send us secure messages using any device, similar to if you had filed your form through the USCIS online account.Have not yet created a USCIS online accountYou can call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833) from Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern. When you call the USCIS Contact Center, say “Afghan” to be routed to live assistance. You may have to wait to speak to a representative by phone. The USCIS Contact Center will not provide interpreters who speak Dari or Pashto when you call.If you want to speak to a USCIS representative and your issue cannot be resolved right away, we will send your request to a USCIS immigration services officer. We will email you to confirm your request and give an estimate when we will contact you.Please have the following information ready when you call the USCIS Contact Center:Your full name (first, middle, if applicable, and last);Your date of birth;Your current U.S. residential address; andYour receipt number for your Form I-485 and/or Form I-589.The USCIS Contact Center representative may also ask you to provide additional biographic or other information to verify your identity.If you are a parent of a parolee who is under age 18:We will not disclose information about a parolee under age 18 unless the parent or legal guardian calling the USCIS Contact Center appears on the child’s application or petition or in the corresponding USCIS system of record. Before discussing the child’s case, USCIS Contact Center representatives will verify the individual caller’s relationship to the child based on current information in our system of record. We will also ask the parent to verify the child’s:Full name (First, Middle, if applicable, and Last);Date of birth;Current U.S. residential address; andReceipt number for the Form I-485 or Form I-589 that is the basis for considering an extension of the child’s initial parole period.The USCIS Contact Center representative may ask the parent to provide additional biographic or other information to verify the parent’s (and child’s) identity.Consideration for Case-by-Case Extension of Initial Parole for Certain Afghan Nationals Under the Age of 14 Q: What if an Afghan national under the age of 14 does not have a pending application for re-parole, for asylum, or for a Green Card?  Answer: DHS is in the process of considering these individuals on a case-by-case basis, for a 2-year extension of their initial period of parole. In particular, those who are eligible for case-by-case consideration of extension of parole include certain Afghan nationals under 14 years old who were paroled into the United States, primarily under Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), with OAR or PAR classes of admission who have not, as of Sept. 26, 2023, filed:  Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records (to apply for re-parole);  Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status; or Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal.  This is a vulnerable population due to their age and because many likely are present in the United States without a parent or legal guardian. Many of these Afghan nationals may lack the capacity, access to resources, and general ability to navigate a complex immigration system, and as a result, have not filed Form I-131 (for re-parole), Form I-485, or Form I-589, either directly or through a legal service provider on their behalf. If they do not maintain parole, they will lose their eligibility for essential benefits, such as those offered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement. Losing parole could also mean they fail to maintain a lawful status for purposes of adjusting their status to that of a lawful permanent resident in the future. If we extend an Afghan national’s initial parole period, DHS will update the Form I-94 online to reflect the extended parole period. On CBP’s Form I-94 webpage, individuals can retrieve and download this updated Form I-94 as evidence of their extended parole period. To access the Form I-94, they will need to enter their:  First and last name; Date of birth; Document number or A-Number (including the letter A); and  Country of citizenship.  CBP has instructions on how to look up the most current Form I-94 in English  (PDF), Dari  (PDF), and Pashto  (PDF). Afghan parolees may pursue multiple immigration pathways at the same time. This process does not affect other benefit requests, including for Temporary Protected Status or asylum. Note that parole will terminate automatically when a parolee leaves the United States. If a parolee wishes to leave and then return to the United States, they must first apply for advance parole using Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. A previously filed request for re-parole will not be considered a request for an advance parole document.  Streamlined Re-Parole Application ProcessQ1: I am currently outside the United States. Can I request re-parole under this streamlined process?A. No. To request re-parole under this streamlined process, you must currently be in the United States and have a class of admission of OAR or PAR. For additional information about humanitarian or significant public benefit parole for individuals outside the United States, please visit uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarianparole.Q2. Is the new re-parole application process the same whether you apply through a USCIS online account or by paper form? For example, will the fee exemption for re-parole and EAD requests apply to both online and paper filings?A. Yes. Whether you apply for re-parole online or on paper, the streamlined application process is the same and the fee exemption applies. However, by applying for re-parole through a USCIS online account, you can prevent mistakes such as a missing signature, missing pages, or an incomplete application. These are common reasons why we reject some forms filed on paper.You can also access your USCIS online account from your electronic device and submit a form, upload required evidence, and update your address in your account. If you don’t complete your form right away, it will be saved in draft form for 30 days. You can view case status, case history, and documents uploaded to support your case, as well as notices we post to your account, such as biometrics scheduling, receipt notices and requests for evidence. We have resources in Dari and Pashto to help guide you through the steps to set up your free online account.Q3. Is there a cut-off date for Afghan parolees to file for re-parole under the new fee-exempt application process?A. Yes, Afghan nationals with no approved immigration status should file for re-parole before their initial parole expires and from June 8, 2023, through Jan. 31, 2025. If your parole expires, you are no longer in a period of stay authorized unless you have been granted an immigration status such as asylum, lawful permanent resident status, or Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or are otherwise in a period of authorized stay such as having a pending asylum application. If you are granted re-parole, you also remain eligible to receive certain benefits and services funded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). As a reminder, TPS beneficiaries are not eligible for certain statutory Afghan parolee benefits if their parole lapses.Q4. What if I have already submitted (or someone has submitted on my behalf) a Form I-131 to request re-parole before DHS announced this new streamlined process?A. If you have already submitted (or someone else has submitted on your behalf) a Form I-131 to request re-parole before the launch of this new streamlined re-parole process on June 8, 2023, please email HumanitarianParole@uscis.dhs.gov. Please include “Afghan re-parole” and your IOE receipt number in the subject of your email. We will re-route previously filed re-parole applications into the new streamlined process if you email us identifying yourself. If we approve your request for re-parole, you will then need to separately request a new EAD, which will be fee exempted, by filing Form I-765 with a copy of your re-parole approval notice.You may also submit a new re-parole request, using the streamlined process announced in this message, to receive the fee exemption and concurrent EAD processing. If you submit a new request under this streamlined process, please indicate in your email to HumanitarianParole@uscis.dhs.gov that you wish to withdraw your pending request. Again, please include your IOE receipt number and “Afghan Re-Parole” in the subject line of your email.Q5. I understand the application process to request re-parole and an employment authorization is fee-exempt for certain Afghan nationals. Do I need to submit a separate form to request the fee exemption?A. No. We will automatically remove any filing fees associated with your request for re-parole and EAD if you are an Afghan national and you were paroled into the United States under an OAR or PAR class of admission.Q6. Do I need to submit a Tazkira as an identity document?A. No. You must submit at least 1 government-issued identity document that shows your photo, name, and date of birth, such as an EAD, driver’s license, passport, or Tazkira. The identity document you submit does not need to be a Tazkira.If you submit any document containing foreign language to USCIS, you also must include a full English-language translation that a translator has certified as complete and accurate, as well as the translator’s certification that they are competent to translate from the foreign language into English.Q7. Can applicants request expedited processing when they are filing for re-parole using the online Form I-131?A. Yes. We are prioritizing, based on the parole expiration date, to generally expedite the adjudication of all Forms I-131 filed by Afghan parolees who are requesting re-parole under the streamlined process. However, if you request expedited processing, then you must submit an additional explanation with the reason or reasons for your expedite request. To learn more about making an expedite request, visit the How to Make an Expedite Request webpage for more information.Q8. Will legal representatives or an accredited representative who assist me with filing my Form I-131 for re-parole need to file a Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative?A. If you choose to apply with the assistance of an attorney or accredited representative instead of on your own, the legal representative or accredited representative who assists you must submit a Form G-28 for each family member they represent. Afterward, if you choose to work with another attorney or accredited representative to file for asylum or a Green Card, that attorney may also submit a Form G-28 for those immigration filings. Having multiple Forms G-28 will not impact different filings.Q9. I recently received notification that USCIS rejected my Form I-131 for an incorrect fee. Can you please explain why?A. We have seen a slight increase in rejections for a missing fee for Forms I-131 filed on paper with our Lockbox, even though no fee is required for this streamlined process. This is because applicants are not properly listing their class of admission as “OAR” or “PAR.” If you list something other than “OAR” or “PAR,” we will not adjudicate your case under the streamlined process. This means your application may be routed to an incorrect office or we may reject or deny your case. We strongly encourage applicants to submit their re-parole requests through a USCIS online account to reduce filing errors, rejection errors, and processing delays.Q10. How should I list my mailing and physical addresses if my mailing address is different from my physical address?A. Currently, Form I-131 only allows individuals to list 1 address.

Please update your information with both USCIS and USPS.Important note: USCIS will mail EADs to the recipient at the address provided on Form I-131, or the most recent address on file with us.USCIS Online AccountQ1. Is the new re-parole application only available to file through the USCIS online account?A. No. There is also a paper-filing option. For more information about how to file on paper, visit Re-Parole Process for Certain Afghans. We encourage you to file through the online account. Filing online will help you avoid common mistakes such as a missing signature, missing pages, or an incomplete application. We reject some forms filed on paper because of these issues. You can also get case status updates, case history, and access notices we post to your account. You will also have access to the documents you uploaded to support your case, among other benefits.Q2. Why must children under age 18 have their own USCIS online account?A. To file online under the streamlined process for self-petitioners, each applicant must have their own unique email address and account. A parent or legal guardian may create an account for their minor child if the purpose is to submit a form on behalf of the minor. If a parent or legal guardian is not available, a primary caregiver or legal assistance provider may also assist such a child with a Form I-131 application to request re-parole and an EAD.Q3. Can a parent establish a single USCIS online account and apply for derivatives so families can apply together like in other parole processes such as Uniting for Ukraine?A. Not under this streamlined process. Each family member, even children under age 18, must have their own USCIS online account because the system requires a unique email address.The Uniting for Ukraine process is a separate, distinct process with its own requirements.Q4. Is there anything we should do differently on the Form I-131 if we are applying for re-parole for a child under the age of 14 than we would do for applicants 14 and older?A. When filing for re-parole through the USCIS online account, parents or legal guardians may sign on behalf of a minor child under the age of 14. Children under the age of 14 may also sign for themselves. If a parent is filling out the information for their child, the parent must fill out the information in the “preparer” section.Q5. I have filed for re-parole for my child under 14 years old through the USCIS online account. How should I sign my name on the online form on behalf of my child?A. Afghan minors may apply for re-parole on their own behalf, without a parent or legal guardian signing. If a parent signs on behalf of a minor child, the parent must submit a birth certificate or adoption decree to establish the parent-child relationship. A legal guardian may also sign on behalf of a child who is under 14 years of age, as well as for a mentally incompetent person of any age. We require documentation to establish a legal guardian’s authority to sign a benefit request on behalf of a child or mentally incompetent requestor. Acceptable documentation includes, but is not limited to, official letters of guardianship or other orders issued by a court or government agency legally authorized to make such appointment under the law governing the place where the child or incapacitated requestor resides. See PM Vol 1, Part B, Chapter 2 for additional information.Q6. Do parents or legal guardians need to provide any different or additional evidence for children under 14 years old?A. Each individual must file their own re-parole application, regardless of age. A parent or legal guardian may complete the request for a minor under 14 years old seeking re-parole, by signing on the minor’s behalf and providing evidence of the legal relationship. A legal guardian may also sign on behalf of a mentally incompetent person of any age. We require documentation to establish a legal guardian’s authority to sign a benefit request on behalf of a child or mentally incompetent requestor. Acceptable documentation includes, but is not limited to, official letters of guardianship or other orders issued by a court or government agency legally authorized to make such appointment under the law governing the place where the child or incapacitated requestor resides. See PM Vol 1, Part B, Chapter 2 for additional information.Afghan minors may also apply for parole on their own behalf, without a parent or legal guardian signing.Q7. Will legal representatives have access to all of their clients’ notices and documents?A. If a legal representative has been linked to their client’s USCIS online account, they will be able to access all the notices we send to the client’s account. Please visit our Online Filing for Attorneys and Accredited Representatives webpage to guide you.Q8. Is the USCIS online account available in Dari and Pashto?A. No. The USCIS online account is only available in English. All USCIS forms are only available in English, whether they are available online or on paper. However, we provide key instructions in Dari and Pashto via video.Employment Authorization Document (EAD)Q1. How soon will I receive my new EAD after being granted re-parole under the streamlined application process?A. We will work through a streamlined process to ensure timely processing of re-parole and EAD requests from eligible Afghan nationals. The online option may further reduce processing time by eliminating the need to mail forms to USCIS. Filing online also prevents common mistakes we see with paper filings that cause unnecessary delays. After we approve your re-parole application, we will automatically begin adjudicating your EAD request and will mail your new EAD to your address on record.As a reminder, if you move, you must update your address with USCIS through your USCIS online account or by submitting Form AR-11, Alien’s Change of Address Card. We have tutorial videos showing you how to update your address through your account and how to submit Form AR-11 online. Report your new address to USCIS within 10 days each time you move, even if you are moving to a temporary location.If you have not reported your change of address within 10 days of your move, you must still update your address with USCIS as soon as possible. Please remember that changing your address with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or another U.S. government agency will not change your address with USCIS. Please update your information with both USCIS and USPS.Important note: USCIS will mail EADs to the recipient at the address provided on Form I-131, or the most recent address on file with us.Q2. Will the USCIS receipt notice for a re-parole and EAD request show an automatic extension of re-parole and employment authorization?A. No. When you apply for re-parole, you are applying for a new period of parole, not an extension of the initial parole period. If we approve your re-parole request, you are employment authorized incident to parole.Q3. If my name is incorrectly spelled on my current EAD based on my initial parole, and I do not correct it before I file for re-parole, does this mean I cannot file for re-parole?A. No. As part of the re-parole request, you should submit the Form I-131 under the correct spelling of your name. In addition, you will need to submit government-issued evidence showing the correct spelling of your name. This evidence may be in the form of a Tazkira or the biographic page of your passport. You must also include an English translation of documents in a language other than English.BiometricsQ1. Do I need to submit any biometrics, including fingerprints or a new photo, as part of this new re-parole application process?A. After we receive and accept your Form I-131 requesting re-parole, we will inform you in writing if you need to attend a biometric services appointment. If you do, there will be no biometric services fee, and the notice we send you will provide you the location of your designated USCIS application support center and the date and time of your appointment. If you do not attend your biometric services appointment, we may deny your application. We may be able to reuse previously submitted biometrics provided during Operation Allies Welcome for certain Afghan nationals. In those cases, you will not receive a biometric services appointment notice.Medical ExamsQ1. Will I need to submit a new Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, to apply for re-parole under the new application process?A. No. We do not require Form I-693 for re-parole.Check Case StatusQ1. How can I check the status of my re-parole application and EAD request?A. If you applied for re-parole by submitting your Form I-131 through your USCIS online account, you can check the status of your case in your account. We have a short video on how you can check your case status in your account. You can also check the status of your case, including a standalone EAD request, using Case Status Online and entering your receipt number.Processing TimesQ1. What is the estimated processing time for re-parole applications under this new application process for Afghan nationals?A. At this time, we cannot predict what the processing times will be. However, please know that we are adjudicating these re-parole requests under a streamlined process to ensure timely processing of re-parole requests from eligible Afghan nationals and prioritize processing of re-parole applications as we receive them. The online option can further help reduce processing time in general because you will not have to mail a form to USCIS. Filing online may also prevent common mistakes that we see with paper filings, which also cause unnecessary delays.Q2. How will re-parole applications be processed? For example, are you prioritizing applications based on parole expiration dates or first in, first out?A. We adjudicate re-parole adjudications as we receive them, but we consider overall circumstances including when an individual's initial parole may be expiring. However, please keep in mind that any form filing mistakes (such as a missing signature or missing pages seen more commonly in paper filings) can delay processing of re-parole applications.Q3. What if my initial parole expires while my re-parole application is pending? Will you extend my parole while you process my re-parole application?A. After your initial parole expires, you no longer are in a period of stay authorized unless you have been granted an immigration status, such as asylum or TPS, or are otherwise in a period of stay authorized, such as if you have a pending asylum, TPS, or Green Card application. We encourage you to file your re-parole application as soon as possible.Form I-94Q1. Will I get a new Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, from CBP?A. If we approve your re-parole request after you file Form I-131 through the streamlined process, your Form I-94 will be updated and attached to your USCIS-issued approval notice. You may also be able to view and print a copy of your updated Form I-94 on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form I-94 website shortly after the approval of your re-parole request.Q2. How can I check if I have an OAR or PAR class of admission?A. The class of admission is indicated on your Form I-94. Individuals who received their Form I-94 at the time of their parole into the United States should visit the CBP Form I-94 website to view and print a copy of their Form I-94. To access your Form I-94, you will need to enter your first and last name, date of birth, document number or A-number (including the letter A), and your country of citizenship. CBP has instructions on how to look up your current Form I-94 in English  (PDF), Dari  (PDF), and Pashto  (PDF).If you did not receive an OAR or PAR class of admission on your Form I-94, please first check CBP’s Form I-94 website to see if your class of admission has been updated. If not, please contact CBP, go to CBP’s I-94 OAW Questions webpage. At the top of the question form there is a “Topic” drop-down menu; select “I-94/Traveler Compliance.” Next, for the “Applicable Issue” drop-down menu, select “Operation Allies Refuge (OAR/OAW).”Other Parole Categories with DT Class of AdmissionQ1. Certain Ukrainian parolees received extensions of initial parole period as noted on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) website. Why is the U.S. government not automatically extending parole for Afghan nationals?A. Before the launch of Uniting for Ukraine, certain Ukrainian nationals and their immediate family were paroled into the United States in 2021 during an approximate 8-week period after Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and before the Uniting for Ukraine process became available. These individuals were generally paroled for a period of 1 year, while participants in Uniting for Ukraine received a 2-year period of parole. DHS extended the parole period to make their parole period the same as the 2-year period of parole that parolees under Uniting for Ukraine received. DHS did not automatically grant re-parole to either of these populations. DHS similarly extended the initial parole periods for certain Afghan nationals who received less than 2 years of parole in July 2022.Q2. If I have a DT Class of Admission, can I request re-parole and an EAD under this new application process?A. No. “DT” is a class of admission usually used for parole periods of 1 year or less. If you are an Afghan national who meets 1 of the criteria listed below, CBP may have already updated your class of admission to “OAR” and extended your parole period to 2 years after you were paroled into the United States. Visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form I-94 website to view and print a copy of your current Form I-94. CBP has instructions in English  (PDF), Dari  (PDF), and Pashto  (PDF) on how to look up your Form I-94.Before you file a request for re-parole, you may need to contact CBP to update your class of admission, if you did not receive an “OAR” or “PAR” class of admission on your Form I-94 and you:Are an Afghan national who was paroled into the United States between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2022;Were paroled into the United States after Sept. 30, 2022, and are the spouse or child of an individual paroled into the United States between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2022; orAre the parent or legal guardian of an individual who was paroled into the United States between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2022, as an unaccompanied child.To contact CBP, go to CBP’s I-94 OAW Questions webpage. At the top of the question form there is a “Topic” drop-down menu; select “I-94/Traveler Compliance.” Next, for the “Applicable Issue” drop-down menu, select “Operation Allies Refuge (OAR/OAW).”REAL IDQ1. Do Afghans with re-parole and extension of parole remain eligible for REAL ID compliant driver’s licenses?Yes. Covered parolees who receive re-parole (a new period of parole with new start and end dates) or extension of initial parole (original start date and new end date) from DHS remain eligible for REAL ID compliant driver’s licenses and identification cards.Documentation:Covered parolees with re-parole or an extension of their initial parole may present a Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document, (EAD) with category C11 and a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, extending their EAD validity.DMVs should accept all EADs that have a validity period extended by DHS because they are unexpired. Unexpired EADs include those that bear a “Card Expires” date that has passed, in combination with a Form I-797C extending the EAD validity period, and an EAD that has a future expiration date on its face.Apart from their parole documentation, Afghan parolees may also present valid immigration documents to DMVs that demonstrate lawful status under the REAL ID Act because they may have other pending applications or approved statuses or categories.For more information on immigration documents, including sample images, see the SAVE Commonly Used Immigration Documents page.Verification:SAVE can verify re-parole and extensions of initial parole periods for covered parolees.Many covered parolees will also have automatically extended EADs that SAVE can verify.Covered parolees may have more than one valid immigration status or category, and many are independent categories of lawful status under the REAL ID Act such as pending asylum and Temporary Protected Status (both pending and approved).A first step SAVE verification is automated. If an automated verification can be completed, SAVE provides a response in seconds, which will include one class of admission (COA) and employment authorization information, if any.If the first step SAVE response is not sufficient for a DMV to make an eligibility determination, the DMV should institute Additional Verification.SAVE Additional Verification provides a detailed verification response, including:Parole period,Additional immigration statuses and categories, andPending immigration applications.Additional Verification is a manual process and response times vary. Agencies are encouraged to submit a copy of the parolee’s immigration document(s) when instituting Additional Verification.For more information on Afghan re-parole and parole extensions, see the June 8, 2023, DHS announcement  that certain Afghan nationals may maintain parole and employment authorization for up to two additional years and the USCIS webpage “Re-Parole Process for Certain Afghans.”Federal Benefits and ServicesQ1. If you grant my re-parole request, will I still be able to receive benefits, such as from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for cash and medical assistance?A. Yes. Eligibility for ORR-funded services extends to qualifying Afghan parolees, including those granted re-parole under the new re-parole process beginning in June, as well as Afghan refugees, asylees, special immigrants, and other ORR-eligible populations. (See ORR Policy Letters 16-01 and 22-02  (PDF) for more details.) As a reminder, TPS beneficiaries are not eligible for certain Afghan parolee benefits if their parole lapses. Afghan parolees may be eligible for other benefits as well.Q2. Are Afghan parolees able to use ORR-funded services to apply for re-parole under the streamlined application process?A: Yes. Afghan parolees in an authorized period of parole are eligible to apply for re-parole through USCIS’ streamlined process using ORR-funded legal services.Note: ORR provides funding for the Immigration Legal Services for Afghan Arrivals (ILSAA) project, which provides free legal services to eligible Afghans in the United States. ILSAA supports pathways to permanent residence, such as obtaining asylum and Special Immigrant Visa status, and also supports family reunification, and other immigration options. Visit https://ilsaa.acf.hhs.gov for more information.Q3. Are Afghan parolees with lapse of parole eligible for ORR-funded services?A. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has issued updated guidance  (PDF) clarifying that ORR benefits and services will be available to Afghan parolees who have a pending re-parole application, a pending asylum application, or a pending adjustment of status application with USCIS. This guidance applies to Afghan parolees whose initial period of parole expires while their applications are pending with USCIS."
