		"question": "Q. Are there any changes to the H-1B electronic registration form for FY 2026?",
		"answer": "A. The FY 2026 H-1B electronic registration form is very similar to past years. You still only need to provide basic information about the prospective petitioner and beneficiary.\nH-1B registrants must also provide valid passport information or valid travel document information for each beneficiary. The passport or travel document provided must be the same as the beneficiary used to enter the United States; if or when they are outside the United States, it must be the document they intend to use to enter the United States if they receive an H-1B visa. Also, the passport or travel document’s validity period must be current and unexpired. Each beneficiary must be registered under only 1 passport or travel document.\nThe passport or travel document must be valid at the time of registration. If the passport or travel document expires between when a registration is submitted and when the H-1B petition is filed, the petitioner should enter data from the new, currently valid passport or travel document on Page 3, Part 3 of Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker. In support of the H-1B petition, the petitioner should provide documentation for both passports or travel documents to establish that the passport or travel document was valid at the time of registration and an explanation as to why there was a change in identifying information.\nIn rare instances, such as for nationals of Venezuela, the passport or travel document may be past the expiration date listed on the document (that is, facially expired) but may have had its validity extended by decree or automatically by the national government or issuing authority that issued the passport or travel document. In these unusual circumstances, we would consider those documents to be valid since they were extended by decree or automatically.​ Registrants should enter the expiration date of the passport or travel document based on the extension, rather than the date which appears in the passport itself. If an H-1B petition is filed based on such registration, USCIS will review the copy of the facially expired document along with any relevant information about the extension to ensure the information entered at registration was accurate."

		"question": "Q. Is there an appeal process for registrations that USCIS finds are invalid duplicates?",
		"answer": "A. We will invalidate duplicate registrations by the same registrant. A registrant will not be able to appeal our finding that the registrations are duplicates."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If registering for the master’s cap based on the expectation that the beneficiary will earn a qualifying advanced degree and the registration is selected under the master’s cap, but the beneficiary does not obtain their qualifying advanced degree by the time of filing the cap-subject H-1B petition, is there a risk that USCIS will deny the cap-subject H-1B petition for that beneficiary?",
		"answer": "A. If we select a registration under the advanced degree exemption (under INA 214(g)(5)(C)) because the beneficiary has earned, or will earn prior to the filing of the petition, a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education, the beneficiary must be eligible for the advanced degree exemption at the time of filing Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. If we select the beneficiary under the advanced degree exemption and the beneficiary has not earned a qualifying master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education at the time of filing the petition, we will deny or reject the petition."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What happens if the prospective employer with a selected registration puts an address on their registration but moves before they file their I-129 petition, such that the addresses on their registration and Form I-129 don’t match?",
		"answer": "A. In such a situation, the petitioner should include a statement with their petition, with supporting documentation, explaining why the address on the registration differs from the address on the petition. If we cannot determine that the petitioning entity is the same as the prospective petitioner identified on the selected registration, we may reject or deny the petition."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What start date should petitioners with a selected registration indicate on their Form I-129?",
		"answer": "A.  If we selected your registration, you must indicate a start date of Oct. 1 or later of the appropriate fiscal year (and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition. If you do not, we will reject or deny your petition."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If there is a typo on the registration in comparison to the Form I-129, will USCIS reject the Form I-129 petition?",
		"answer": "A. Although we will not automatically reject the Form I-129 petition for typos on the selected registration in comparison with the Form I-129, the burden is on the registrant/petitioner to confirm that all registration and petition information is correct and to establish that the H-1B cap petition is based on a valid registration submitted for the beneficiary named in the petition and selected by USCIS."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will the H-1B registration system or the beneficiary-centric selection process affect how USCIS handles the prohibited filing of multiple H-1B petitions for the same beneficiary by related entities?",
		"answer": "A. The prohibition on an employer or related entities filing multiple H-1B cap petitions for the same beneficiary has not changed. Our handling of multiple H-1B cap petitions is consistent with 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G) and Matter of S- Inc., Adopted Decision 2018-02 (AAO Mar. 23, 2018)."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Where should a petitioner with a selected registration file their Form I-129 and supporting documentation?",
		"answer": "A. We accept online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected. Petitioners also have the option of filing a paper Form I-129 H-1B petition and any associated Form I-907 if they prefer. However,  users will not be able to link paper-filed Forms I-129 and I-907 to their online accounts.\nFor paper-filed forms, petitioners must file per the instructions on the H-1B registration selection notice, which may be different from the historical Form I-129 filing jurisdictions for cap cases. Please see our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker webpage for information on the correct location at which to file your cap petition."

		"question": "Q. What happens if a legal representative submits a registration but then stops representing the registrant?",
		"answer": "A. It is up to the representative and registrant to ensure that the registrant maintains access to submissions made for them and any updates related to those submissions. If a registrant no longer wants their attorney involved, they can end the relationship with the representative, and the registrant will still be able to see all registration information in their own organizational account(s). However, the registrant will not be able to add a new attorney or representative to H-1B registrations prepared or submitted by the previous attorney."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will the system prevent the representative and the registrant from both entering the same beneficiary?",
		"answer": "A. The system will not prevent a representative and a registrant from both registering the same beneficiary. However, we added duplicate checker functionality to the electronic registration process. Before you submit your registration(s), you can check whether the registrant named in the draft submission previously submitted a registration for any of the beneficiaries included in that draft submission for the same fiscal year. Using this check does not guarantee that you will not submit a duplicate. This check will compare the beneficiaries listed in the draft with any registrations previously submitted during this registration period. It will not check for duplicates within that draft or between drafts. Even when using this check function, the representative and the registrant still are responsible for ensuring that they do not submit duplicate registrations. To help with that, we also offer a tool to download a .csv file and search for duplicate entries. In addition, we recommend that attorneys and authorized individuals who work for the same company communicate among themselves to eliminate duplicates before submitting their registrations."

		"question": "Q. I am a legal representative submitting the H-1B registration online, and the\n, asks if I have an online account and what my account number is. How do I find it?",
		"answer": "Q. I am a legal representative submitting the H-1B registration online, and the Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, asks if I have an online account and what my account number is. How do I find it?\nA. If you have paper-filed cases that are eligible to be added to your online account, your USCIS notices for those cases should include your online account number. If you do not know your account number, this will not affect your H-1B registration. You can click “No” to this question and move on to the next question."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will both the attorney and the client (prospective registrant) need to create a USCIS online account for the H-1B electronic registration process?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Both the client (prospective registrant) and attorney will need a USCIS online account for the H-1B electronic registration process. If you are an attorney and already have an existing legal representative account, your account will work with the H-1B electronic registration process. You do not need to create a new legal representative account unless you do not have one.\nAll clients (prospective registrants) will need to create an H-1B organizational account to review and approve the Form G-28 and H-1B registrations as part of the electronic registration process."

		"question": "Q. As a registrant, can I delete my account?",
		"answer": "A. See the Tips for Filing Forms Online webpage for information on how to delete your account."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does a duplicate registration in a submission batch affect all registrations in the batch or only the duplicate registration?",
		"answer": "A. We would invalidate only the duplicate registrations. If you properly submitted other registrations for different beneficiaries, these valid registrations would remain in the system for the selection process. You have until  the initial registration period closes, to log into your account, review all of your H-1B registrations, and delete any duplicate registrations. This is also true if one of the registrations submitted in a batch contains an error. You would be able to delete the registration for the beneficiary that contained the error without affecting the rest of the batch submission."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. As a legal representative, how will I know that the registrant has gone into the system and approved my Form G-28 and the H-1B registrations?",
		"answer": "A. You can log into your account to check if the registrant has approved the Form G-28 and the H-1B registrations. Our system will not separately notify you that the registrant has approved the Form G-28 and H-1B registrations."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. After the legal representative submits a registration, will the registrant be notified via email or by logging into their account?",
		"answer": "A. The legal representative will need to notify the registrant that the registration and Form G-28 were entered for the registrant’s review; or the registrant can see the registrations and Form G-28 by logging into their account. Our system will not separately notify the registrant."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can an attorney represent a petitioner for an I-129 petition if the petitioner completed the H-1B electronic registration process without the help of the attorney?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. However, to authorize their representation, the attorney would need to file a Form G-28 with the Form I-129 H-1B petition. Even if the attorney submitted a Form G-28 to represent a registrant for the registration process, they would still need to submit a new Form G-28 with the Form I-129 petition."

		"question": "Q. How do I reset the password for my USCIS account or get technical support?",
		"answer": "A. To reset your password, please visit the Forgot Your Password page on our website. To review the steps on how to create an online account, sign into your account, or complete an H-1B registration with USCIS, please see the “How to Register” tab above.  If you are experiencing technical difficulties with your online account or your H-1B registration, send us a message using the Request for Account Help Form.

		"answer": "A. March 7, 2025, at noon Eastern."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will the system allow for multiple staff members to log into my account at the same time?",
		"answer": "A. No. You must agree to the Terms of Use, which include an attestation that you are the person that holds the account and that you will not share your account with others or allow others to use your account.\nHowever, we launched USCIS organizational accounts that allow multiple people within an organization and their legal representatives to collaborate on preparation of H-1B registrations, H-1B petitions, and any associated Form I-907."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How should a registrant with a selected registration notify USCIS if they do not intend to file a petition?",
		"answer": "A. Since no H-1B petition will be filed, we will have no paper file that we can use to match the notification with the registration. We suggest that the employer keep documentation of the reason for not filing, so that the employer would be able to show us the documentation if we have questions."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If a registration is selected and the petition is filed during the 90-day period, but it is rejected, will a petitioner be eligible to refile if they are still within the 90-day window?",
		"answer": "A. A petitioner is eligible to refile their rejected petition as long as it is refiled within the designated 90-day filing window. The petitioner must file their petition at the correct location and must include all required fees and supporting evidence with the filing."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What should I do if information from the delivery service  suggests there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted?",
		"answer": "A. If you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but information from the delivery service suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice and the following:\nIf you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. We may deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year, and will not refund the filing fees\nIf you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, we will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will USCIS invalidate registrations as duplicates if the same representative submits 2 registrations for the same beneficiary, but for 2 unrelated companies?",
		"answer": "A. No. We would not consider such registrations duplicates. However, we will consider registrations as duplicates if the registrations are for the same prospective petitioners and the same prospective beneficiaries.\nFurthermore, we would consider a registration to not be properly submitted if it contained an attestation that was not true and correct (for example, that a company worked with another entity to submit multiple registrations for the same beneficiary to unfairly increase chances of selection for that beneficiary). For more information, please see the “Unfairly Increasing Chances of Selection” tab above."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If one person is the authorized signatory for 2 separate companies, could this person use their email with different domain names to set up a registrant account and submit registrations for the 2 companies?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, they may. They will need 2 separate accounts, one for each company. They will also need a separate email address for each account."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What happens to my registration submission if the payment fails to initially go through?",
		"answer": "A. If your payment initially fails or is canceled before it can be processed on Pay.gov, you will see a payment failure notification on the screen and your registration will not be submitted. Your registration data will be available in your account for 30 days from the date you last worked on your registrations. You can sign-in to your account at any time before the initial registration period closes to try the payment and registration submission again. You must submit all registrations and payments successfully before the initial registration period closes for consideration in the initial registration period selection process"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What happens if my payment initially clears, but then fails (for example, payment is made using an electronic check that my bank then returns)?",
		"answer": "A. It is your responsibility to submit valid payment.\nWhen paying by check, please be sure to enter the bank routing number and bank account number accurately. While the status of the registration in the system will indicate “submitted” following completion of the Pay.gov payment process, the submission will only be valid once your payment clears. If your checking account information is not accurate, your payment will be declined when presented to your financial institution. If your payment is declined, your H-1B registration will be invalidated.\nIf payment is made with a credit card or debit card, the status of the registration in the system will indicate “submitted” following completion of the Pay.gov payment process. The submission, however, will only be valid once processing of the payment is completed. If the payment is later declined, not reconciled, disputed, or otherwise invalidated after submission, the registration will be invalidated.\nIf your payment fails, we will attempt to notify you, but the burden will be on you to determine the status of your required payment. If your registration is invalidated while the registration period is still open, you will be able to submit a new registration with a valid payment. If your registration is invalidated due to a failed payment after the registration period closes, you will not be able to submit a new registration. We may deny or revoke the approval of an H-1B petition if we determines that the fee associated with the registration is declined, not reconciled, disputed, or otherwise invalid after submission. The registration fee is non-refundable and due at the time the registration is submitted."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. May an authorized signatory within the company, who is different from the authorized signatory who signed the H-1B electronic registration, sign the paper Form I-129?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. The authorized signatory who signed the registration does not need to be the same authorized signatory who signs the Form I-129. However, the prospective petitioner (registrant) at the registration stage must match the petitioner at the Form I-129 stage."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What time zone does the H-1B registration system and Form I-129 petitions submitted online use?",
		"answer": "A. H-1B registrations and Forms I-129 that are submitted online via a USCIS  online account will reflect a filing time based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\nFor Form I-129 petitions submitted online, the receipt date will be based on UTC, not the local time of the submitter or the location of the officer that will ultimately work the petition. This may result in a later receipt date than anticipated if filing late in the day. Please verify that any filings are submitted on time to ensure that there are no adverse impacts to eligibility."

	{
		"question": "Q. I indicated on a registration that a beneficiary was not eligible for the master’s cap, but their selection notice indicates they were selected in the master’s cap. Is this an error on the selection notice?",
		"answer": "A. First, you should verify your indication on the registration regarding the beneficiary ‘s eligibility for consideration in the master’s cap.\nHowever, even if you did not indicate the beneficiary was eligible for consideration in the master’s cap, they may still have been properly considered in the master’s cap. The beneficiary would have been entered into the master’s cap selection process if they had another registration submitted on their behalf that indicated they were eligible for consideration in the master’s cap. Because of the beneficiary-centric selection process, all registrations submitted for that beneficiary are selected if the beneficiary is selected. Accordingly, if the beneficiary was selected in the master’s cap, all registrations would indicate that selection, even if a particular registration did not indicate eligibility for the master’s cap.\nBased on DHS regulations, the general cap selection is conducted first by selecting beneficiaries from among all properly submitted registrations, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption. Then the master’s cap selection is conducted. Accordingly, any beneficiary selected in the initial master’s cap selection was not selected in the initial general cap selection.\nYou are still eligible to file a petition based on this selected registration during the applicable filing period. However, you would need to establish the beneficiary’s eligibility for the master’s cap as of the time of filing the Form I-129 petition.\nOrganizational Accounts Frequently Asked Questions"
