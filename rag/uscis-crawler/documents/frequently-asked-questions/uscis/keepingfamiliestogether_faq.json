		"question": "Q. What is Keeping Families Together?",
		"answer": "A. Keeping Families Together is a process that allows certain alien spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for parole in place to enable them to apply for lawful permanent resident status without having to be separated from their families by leaving the United States for processing. Parole is an exercise of DHS’s discretionary authority under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to allow certain alien “applicants for admission” to be present in the United States on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit. The INA defines an “applicant for admission,” in relevant part, as an alien “present in the United States who has not been admitted.” Aliens who are present in the United States without admission or parole may be considered for parole in place under this process because they remain “applicants for admission.” Parole in place is available only for aliens who are present in the United States. Those who receive parole are eligible to apply for work authorization for the period of parole"

		"question": "Q. Which form should I file to apply for Keeping Families Together? Can I file online?",
		"answer": "A. Requestors (the alien spouse or stepchild) must file Form I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens, under this process. The form can only be filed online. Paper-based applications sent to USCIS by mail will be rejected (not accepted or receipted). We have created a Filing Guide for Form I-131F to help individuals as they prepare to file a request for parole in place through the online process."

	{
		"question": "Q. Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my Form I-131F or guarantee that it will be approved. Is this true?",
		"answer": "A. No. While an attorney or accredited representative may charge a fee to prepare your request, anyone who guarantees faster processing or a positive outcome by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you. Visit our Avoid Scams page to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.\nPlease also remember that USCIS will begin accepting requests for this process on Aug. 19, 2024. Any filings received before this date will be rejected by USCIS (not accepted or receipted)."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If my Keeping Families Together request is granted, how long will my parole period last?",
		"answer": "A. In general, if you are granted parole as an alien spouse or alien stepchild of a U.S. citizen under this process, your parole period will be valid as of the date USCIS approves your Form I-131F and will expire 3 years from that date. However, parole terminates automatically if you depart the United States. Parole may also be terminated at any time in DHS’s discretion upon a determination that parole is no longer warranted, for example, following the commission of criminal conduct.\nAs long as your parole remains valid (that is, is not expired or terminated), you will be considered in a period of authorized stay. As a parolee, you may apply for any immigration status for which you may be otherwise eligible, including adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident."

		"question": "Q. If I meet the criteria listed above, will I be guaranteed to have my Form I-131F approved under this process?",
		"answer": "A. No. All requests under this process are considered on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances of each individual request and evaluating whether parole is warranted as a matter of discretion for significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If I entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa or was admitted in another status and overstayed, am I eligible for Keeping Families Together?",
		"answer": "A. No. Parole in place is only available to an “applicant for admission,” which the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines, in relevant part, as an alien “present in the United States who has not been admitted.” This means that aliens who were last admitted on valid nonimmigrant visas or were admitted in another status but have remained in the United States beyond their authorized period of stay cannot request parole in place under this process. However, an alien who was previously “inspected and admitted” to the United States may be eligible under the law to apply for adjustment of status as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen, if they are the beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition. For more information, please visit the Adjustment of Status webpage."

		"question": "Q. I have already departed the United States for an immigrant visa interview appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. Can I make a request for Keeping Families Together?",

		"question": "Q. I have Deferred Action under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Am I eligible to make a request for Keeping Families Together?",
		"answer": "A. If you are a current DACA recipient or TPS beneficiary, you may request parole in place under this process if you are currently present in the United States without admission or parole and you are otherwise eligible. However, if you previously departed the United States and re-entered with a TPS Travel Authorization Document or an Advance Parole Document, you are not eligible for parole in place under this process because you have already been admitted or paroled into the United States.\nIf you are in a valid period of parole at the time your DACA renewal request is adjudicated, USCIS will deny your DACA renewal request as a matter of discretion."

	{
		"question": "Q. I once had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but my DACA or TPS has lapsed. Am I eligible to make a request for Keeping Families Together?",
		"answer": "A. If your DACA or TPS has lapsed, you may request parole in place under this process if you are currently present in the United States without admission or parole. However, if you previously departed the United States and re-entered with a TPS Travel Authorization Document or an Advance Parole Document, you are not eligible for parole in place under this process because you have already been admitted or paroled into the United States.\nIf you submit a DACA renewal request while in a valid period of parole or are in a valid period of parole at the time your DACA renewal request is adjudicated, USCIS will deny your DACA renewal request as a matter of discretion."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will I be able to request re-parole (a new period of parole) and renew my employment authorization when the duration of my parole under Keeping Families Together ends?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is not planning a re-parole process. If you do not apply for adjustment of status or receive another immigration status before your period of parole expires, you may begin to accrue or resume accruing unlawful presence. Any parole-based employment authorization granted by USCIS (category (c)(11)) will also generally expire at the same time your parole period expires.\nHowever, if you file for adjustment of status, you may request employment authorization on the basis of your pending adjustment application, Form I-485 (category (c)(9)). If approved, you can receive employment authorization with a five-year validity date under category (c)(9). If your parole under this process is granted, you should not delay in filing their subsequent I-130 petition and I-485 application."

		"question": "Q. How do I make a request under Keeping Families Together?",
		"answer": "A. You (the alien spouse or stepchild) must submit Form I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens, online with the applicable filing fee of $580. You may not file for this process using a paper form. Any paper filing received by USCIS will be rejected (not accepted or receipted) and you will have to file again to have your request considered.\nYou must submit with your online request documentation establishing that you meet all eligibility criteria and evidence of any additional factors you would like USCIS to consider.

		"answer": "A. If you are making a request for this process as the spouse of a U.S. citizen, you must submit documentation that shows you have been continuously physically present in the United States from June 17, 2014, up until the time of filing your request, to meet the continuous physical presence requirement.\nIf you are the stepchild of a U.S. citizen, you must submit documentation that shows you have been continuously physically present in the United States from June 17, 2024, until the time of filing your request.\nYou should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence.\nIt is helpful to submit evidence of your physical presence during at least each year of the required period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether you have established by a preponderance of the evidence that you were continuously physically present in the United States for the required period.\nIf gaps in your documentation raise questions about whether you were continuously physically present in the United States for the required period, we may issue, at our discretion, a Request for Evidence to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous physical presence."

		"question": "Q. What evidence can I submit to show I merit a favorable exercise of discretion for this process?",
		"answer": "A. Our decision whether to grant your request is a discretionary, case-by-case determination. Even if you establish that you have met all the criteria for eligibility, we will examine the totality of the circumstances in your individual case to determine whether your request should be granted based on a significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion based on a review of all positive and negative factors present in your case. If there are negative factors that outweigh the positive factors presented by the evidence, we may deny your request. If you have a final unexecuted removal order or non-disqualifying criminal history, you may provide additional documentation that you believe demonstrates that you merit a favorable exercise of discretion.

		"question": "Q. Will USCIS verify documents or statements I provide to support my request?",
		"answer": "A. USCIS has the authority to verify documents, facts, and statements provided to support immigration requests, including requests under this process. We may contact relatives, educational institutions, other government agencies, or other entities to verify information. In addition, USCIS will conduct background and security checks. If USCIS determines you have made a material misrepresentation or engaged in fraud as part of your request, your request will be denied, and you may be ineligible or inadmissible for other immigration benefits in the future. You may also be subject to criminal prosecution."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Am I required to demonstrate that I am not inadmissible in order to qualify for this process?",
		"answer": "A. No. Parole is neither an admission to the United States nor a determination of admissibility. As a result, requestors do not need to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible as part of this process. However, USCIS may consider facts and circumstances that may give rise to one’s inadmissibility in making the case-by-case discretionary parole determination, and requestors who subsequently apply for adjustment of status will be evaluated for admissibility at that stage."

As a result, requestors do not need to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the public charge ground of inadmissibility as part of this process. However, requestors who subsequently apply for adjustment of status will be evaluated for admissibility, including the public charge ground of inadmissibility, at that stage."

		"question": "Q. Will the information I share in my Keeping Families Together request be used for immigration enforcement purposes?",
		"answer": "A. DHS generally will not use information contained in a request under this process for the purpose of initiating immigration enforcement action, unless DHS determines, in its discretion, that you pose a threat to national security, public safety, or border security.\nThis process does not preclude DHS from, in its discretionary authority, taking enforcement actions in accordance with the INA and consistent with governing policies and practices, against aliens who may be eligible or who have pending requests for parole under this process.\nDHS may disclose information in the request to national security and/or law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than initiation of immigration enforcement proceedings. These purposes include assistance in the consideration of parole, identification or prevention of fraudulent claims, investigation of a possible national security threat, investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, or as otherwise needed, consistent with statutory authorities, obligations, and restrictions, as well as governing privacy and information-sharing policies."

		"question": "Q. If my request is pending and I am encountered by CBP or ICE, will I be placed into removal proceedings?",
		"answer": "A. The Sept. 30, 2021, Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF) direct DHS to focus its limited resources on aliens who pose a threat to our national security, public safety, or border security.\nThose guidelines remain in effect. Filing a request under this process, or eligibility to file a request for parole in place under this process, does not prevent CBP or ICE from taking enforcement action against an individual when otherwise appropriate under applicable law and policy."

USCIS maintains discretion to issue an NTA or refer the case to ICE for possible enforcement action consistent with governing policies and practices, including initiating immigration enforcement proceedings based on a threat to national security, public safety or border security*.\n*NOTE: Consistent with the Sept. 30, 2021, Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF), an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process.

USCIS recognizes common law marriages in adjudicating immigration benefits in certain circumstances and will similarly recognize them for purposes of Keeping Families Together if:\nIf you live in a different state than where you entered into your marriage, you may still be eligible. Some states may recognize a common law marriage contracted in another state even if the recognizing state does not accept common law marriage as a means for its own residents to contract marriage.\nIf you are requesting parole in place under Keeping Families Together on the basis of a common law marriage, you should submit a copy of the statute, regulation, or case law that states the requirements in that jurisdiction for establishing a common law marriage. You should also submit evidence that demonstrates you met the requirements in the jurisdiction for establishing a common law marriage on or before June 17, 2024.

No. A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous physical presence in the United States during the required period for the purpose of Keeping Families Together. For the purpose of this process, a brief, casual, and innocent absence means an absence from the United States that took place prior to June 17, 2024, and:\nHowever, to be eligible for adjustment of status, you must be admissible to the United States.

Convictions for the following offenses are also disqualifying regardless of whether the conviction was a felony or misdemeanor. DHS reserves its discretion to determine that other offenses are disqualifying, even if not listed.\nAll other criminal convictions not listed above, excluding minor traffic offenses, will result in a presumption of ineligibility for this process. To overcome the presumption of ineligibility, you must provide documentation demonstrating positive factors that can be considered in overcoming this presumption and showing that you warrant a favorable exercise of discretion. You should include copies of arrest records and certified court dispositions for each arrest or criminal charge, as well as evidence that you completed your sentence, if applicable.\nEven if you establish that you have met all the criteria for eligibility, and have rebutted the presumption of ineligibility, USCIS will examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether your request should be granted as a matter of discretion for significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What offenses qualify as felonies?",
		"answer": "A. A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of this process."

		"question": "Q. I have pending criminal charges. Am I eligible for this process while the charges remain pending?",
		"answer": "A. No. If you have been charged with any criminal offense and the charges remain pending, we will deny your request and not refund your filing fee. You may make a request for this process once your charges are resolved. However, if your criminal charges result in a conviction, and you are convicted of a crime that renders you ineligible for this process, your request will be denied. If your charges result in a conviction and the conviction does not render you ineligible for this process, the conviction will result in a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility, which may be overcome by demonstrating positive factors that outweigh the negative factors in your case.\nYou should include copies of arrest records and certified court dispositions for each arrest or criminal charge, as well as evidence that you completed your sentence, if applicable. USCIS will weigh the seriousness of the conviction against the positive factors and any other relevant information in each individual case. We will consider all criminal history in determining whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion under this process."

		"question": "Q. What qualifies as a national security, public safety, or border security concern?",
		"answer": "A. If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request indicates that you pose a public safety, national security, or border security concern, we will not grant your parole request. Indicators of national security concerns include, but are not limited to, participation in activities that threaten the United States. Indicators of public safety concerns include, but are not limited to, serious criminal conduct and criminal history. Indicators of border security concerns include apprehension following entry into the United States without authorization on or after Nov. 1, 2020; however, stepchildren who otherwise meet the eligibility criteria will not be disqualified if they entered on or after Nov. 1, 2020."

		"question": "Q. Are dismissed, expunged, vacated, pardoned, deferred, annulled, invalidated, withheld, or sealed convictions subject to the presumption of ineligibility?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Convictions that were, for example, dismissed, expunged, vacated, pardoned, deferred, annulled, invalidated, withheld, or sealed will still create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they may no longer constitute convictions for immigration purposes. You may be able to overcome this presumption, however, depending on the specific facts of your case, including but not limited to the fact that the conviction was expunged or vacated under state law, the reasons for the expungement or vacatur, the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, and any other relevant facts surrounding the original conviction. In addition, USCIS may consider your entire criminal history, if any, along with other facts to determine, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted.\nNOTE: If you were never convicted (for example, you were only arrested), you are not subject to the presumption of ineligibility."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If I have a criminal conviction that makes me presumptively ineligible for Keeping Families Together, how can I overcome that presumption?",
		"answer": "A. The presumption may be rebutted on a case-by-case basis by providing evidence that demonstrates positive and mitigating factors that overcome the presumption. USCIS will weigh the seriousness of the conviction against mitigating factors relating to the conviction as well as other positive factors that suggest you merit a favorable exercise of discretion. The weight of the presumption will be guided by the nature and seriousness of the conviction. A less serious conviction, or a conviction that does not indicate you are a public safety concern, will carry less weight and can be more easily rebutted. In adjudicating parole in place requests on an individualized, case-by-case basis, the nature and seriousness of the conviction will determine the evidence needed to overcome it.\nYou should submit a detailed statement explaining the circumstances of the conviction, any mitigating factors, and any positive factors you want USCIS to consider and any other evidence you think may support your case. USCIS may request additional evidence from you if the evidence you submit initially is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of ineligibility. Examples of factors we will consider in determining whether the presumption of ineligibility based on a criminal conviction can be overcome – such as the age and nature of the conviction, as well as positive factors about the requestor – are described below."

		"answer": "A. No. Misdemeanor convictions for minor traffic offenses, including driving without a license or driving with an expired license, will not make you ineligible for this process or create a presumption of ineligibility."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Are juvenile delinquency dispositions subject to the presumption of ineligibility?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Juvenile delinquency dispositions will create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they do not constitute convictions for immigration purposes. However, the factors considered when determining whether the presumption has been overcome, such as the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, the length of time that has passed since the adjudication, and any other relevant facts surrounding the offense may be especially relevant in such cases. In addition, we may consider your entire criminal history, if any, along with other positive factors to determine, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted.\nIf you cannot provide the record of the disposition because it is sealed or because State law prohibits its disclosure (even to you), USCIS still may request a statement or other information from you to determine whether the presumption has been overcome and a favorable exercise of discretion is otherwise warranted."

Following your submission of your request, USCIS will send you a notification via your myUSCIS account that explains when and where to appear for your biometrics collection appointment. You must print your biometric services appointment notice and bring it with you to your appointment.  If you are unable to attend the appointment, you can reschedule using our online rescheduling request process.

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If my request for Keeping Families Together is approved, will I accrue unlawful presence?",
		"answer": "A. No. If you are granted parole in place under Keeping Families Together, you are in a period of authorized stay, which means you do not accrue unlawful presence while your parole remains valid (that is, not expired or terminated). Importantly, however, if you receive parole in place under Keeping Families Together, it does not erase any unlawful presence accrued before the start of your parole period. Furthermore, a pending request for parole in place does not stop the accrual of unlawful presence.\nIf your parole expires or is otherwise terminated, you will begin accruing unlawful presence unless you are maintaining or obtain another status during the parole period. Parole may be terminated at any time in DHS’s discretion upon a determination that parole is no longer warranted, for example, following the commission of criminal conduct. It is recommended that you apply for lawful permanent resident status as soon as possible after obtaining parole in place under this process. For more information on applying for lawful permanent resident status, please visit the How to Apply for a Green Card webpage."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS does not grant my request, will I be placed in removal proceedings?",
		"answer": "A. If we deny your request for parole in place, we will generally not issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) or refer your case to ICE for possible enforcement action solely based on the denial, unless DHS is initiating immigration enforcement proceedings against you because you are considered a priority under the Sept. 30, 2021, Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF) as a threat to national security, public safety, or border security.*\n*NOTE: Consistent with these guidelines, an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process. However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What happens if my request under Keeping Families Together is granted, but I do not apply for or receive adjustment of status during my parole period?",
		"answer": "A. When the parole period terminates, an alien returns to the same immigration status or category that they maintained before the parole in place, if any (unless that status or category has since expired or terminated), and their case will be dealt with in the same manner as any other applicant for admission, unless they obtained another immigration status or category during the parole period that is still valid beyond the parole end date. As stated above, DHS is not contemplating a re-parole process."

If you are granted parole in place under this process, you may then be eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident by filing Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, in the United States without first seeking a provisional unlawful presence waiver. If your Form I-131F request is granted and you then apply for adjustment of status with USCIS, you will no longer be eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, and we will deny your Form I-601A."

We will not refund the fee you paid for Form I-601A if you file a request for parole in place under this process. In addition, note that if your parole in place is granted and you apply to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident (Form I-485), you will no longer be eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, and we will deny your Form I-601A."

For this reason, you should make sure to include your Form I-601A receipt number on your Form I-131F.\nNOTE: For your case to be identified and potentially prioritized, you must ensure that all biographic information on Form I-131F, including your name, exactly match the information you provided on the Form I-601A you previously filed."

		"question": "Q. I have a pending Form I-601A. What happens to that request if my request under Keeping Families Together is granted?",
		"answer": "A. Your Form I-601A will remain pending and will be adjudicated in turn. However, one of the eligibility requirements for the Form I-601A is that you do not have a pending application for lawful permanent residence with USCIS. Therefore, if you are granted parole in place and file for adjustment of status with USCIS, your pending Form I-601A will be denied."

		"answer": "A. No. The denial of a request for parole in place does not affect the adjudication of the Form I-601A, but the reasons that led to the denial of a parole in place request may also affect eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, including the determination of whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is denied, can I still file a Form I-601A?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Form I-601A has different eligibility requirements than parole in place. A denial of parole in place does not make you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver; however, you should review the reasons for the denial of your parole in place request to determine if any of those reasons also make you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver."

If USCIS approves your request for Keeping Families Together, you can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, under eligibility category (c)(11). You can only apply for employment authorization after your Keeping Families Together request is approved.

If your request for this process is approved and you are later granted an employment authorization document (EAD) under eligibility category (c)(11), your EAD will generally be valid for the same duration as your parole period, which can be up to three years under this process. Once you apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident, you will then be eligible to apply for employment authorization pending adjudicating of your adjustment application under eligibility category (c)(9). You can receive employment authorization with a five-year validity under category (c)(9). If your parole under this process is granted, you should not delay in filing a subsequent I-130 petition and I-485 application."

		"question": "Q. As an employer, if I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for parole in place, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?",
		"answer": "A. An employer may, as they determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting parole in place under this process with documentation verifying their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment of aliens), except in cases involving unscrupulous employers who exploit alien workers by engaging in illegal acts ranging from the payment of substandard wages to imposing unsafe working conditions and facilitating human trafficking and child exploitation, and who therefore may be a DHS worksite enforcement priority as described in the Oct. 12, 2021 memorandum entitled “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual.”"

Parole into the United States is not guaranteed even if you have been granted advance parole prior to leaving the country. You are still subject to immigration inspection at a U.S. port of entry to determine whether you may be paroled into the United States and whether you are eligible for the immigration status you seek. For further information, see Travel Documents | USCIS. Consultation with a qualified attorney or accredited representative is strongly advised prior to any travel outside of the United States."
