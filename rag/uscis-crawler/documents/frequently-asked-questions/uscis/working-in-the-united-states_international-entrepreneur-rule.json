If you have chosen to receive your parole document at your U.S. mailing address but are no longer in the United States and cannot return, you should contact the USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office immediately to notify us of your change of address and request for overseas processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate.

You can show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation by the receipt of significant capital investment from U.S. investors with established records of successful investments in startup entities.\nYou can also show this through significant awards or grants from certain federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide awards or grants to startup entities.\nDHS regulations also include alternative criteria for applicants who partially meet the thresholds for capital investment or government awards or grants and can provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of their entities' significant potential for rapid growth and job creation."

For example, we recognize that many investment firms based in the United States, such as venture capital firms, have a wide range of funding from limited partners that vest control in U.S. citizen partners who manage and even “control” the fund.\nThe applicant must also establish, among other things, that the investor has a successful history of accomplishment making investments in startup entities, and that the investment is a good faith investment of lawfully derived capital."

A “qualified government award or grant” means an award or grant for economic development, research and development, or job creation (or other similar monetary award typically given to startup entities) made by a federal, state, or local government entity (not including foreign government entities) that regularly provides such awards or grants to startup entities. This definition excludes any contractual commitment for goods or services.\nSome examples of qualified government awards and grants may include:"

Every 3 years, by regulation, the threshold monetary amounts must increase according to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. We will publish the new amounts on our website, and a technical update to the regulation itself will appear in the Federal Register. We expect that the next automatic update will go into effect at the beginning of Fiscal Year 2025 (Oct. 1, 2024)."

In your application, you can indicate that you want your startup entity to be considered based on raising more than the threshold amount or based on raising less than the threshold amount plus alternative evidence. To do so, you can check “Yes” for both Question 10 and Question 14 on Form I-941, along with providing alternative evidence.\nThe following checklist of required initial evidence is for informational purposes only.

	{
		"question": "Q. Does the Department of State (including U.S. embassies and consulates), as distinct from DHS, have different requirements for the International Entrepreneur Rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is guided by the requirements of the International Entrepreneur Rule. The Department of State does not make parole determinations under this rule. USCIS first determines whether to authorize parole, and if authorized, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) makes a final parole determination at the port of entry (both USCIS and CBP are components of DHS).\nIf you are outside the United States and need to appear at a U.S. embassy or consulate to complete parole processing, the Department of State conducts additional vetting and, if no new derogatory information or identities are discovered as a result of this process, issues travel documentation on behalf of USCIS. If new information is found by the Department of State through the vetting process, the U.S. embassy or consulate will notify USCIS, which will determine if the new information affects the parole authorization.\nOnce travel documentation is issued, parole is authorized. However, advance authorization of parole by USCIS does not guarantee that you will be paroled by CBP upon your appearance at a port of entry. CBP will make a separate, discretionary determination whether to grant parole at the port of entry. If circumstances do not meaningfully change and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable during the inspection process, however, CBP is likely to grant you parole at a port of entry."

		"answer": "A. A pending or conditionally approved Form I-941 application does not authorize you, if you are present in the United States in nonimmigrant status, to remain in the United States beyond the expiration of your authorized period of stay. Remaining in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay may have immigration consequences."

The maximum initial parole period is 2.5 years, which begins at the time of initial parole by CBP at a U.S. port of entry. If you then depart the United States and are granted parole upon your return at the U.S. port of entry, you may receive parole for up to the remainder of the 2.5years (the initial parole period). Any time you spend outside the United States during your parole period counts toward the maximum initial period of parole.\nIf you are in the United States when we authorize parole, and you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, we will mail you a multi-entry travel document that allows you to seek parole multiple times at a port of entry during its validity period.\nIf you are applying from abroad and receive a boarding foil from a U.S. embassy or consulate to authorize your initial parole into the United States, we will give you further instructions on how to receive a multi-use Form I-512L, Advance Parole document, after you have notified USCIS that CBP has paroled you in the United States."

Processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate may occur within weeks after we issue a Conditional Approval. Biometrics submission and boarding foil processing also depend on the availability of the applicant to appear at the U.S. embassy or consulate for biometrics collection and identity verification.\nTo avoid processing delays, please make sure that your contact information, including your mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number, are correct on your Form I-941 or Form I-131 and that you provide timely updates to USCIS of any changes in your mailing address by following these instructions. A U.S. embassy or consulate may try to contact you by phone or e-mail. If you are an entrepreneur, you may provide your phone number and e-mail address on Form I-941. If you are a spouse or child of an entrepreneur, you may provide your phone number on Form I-131 in the designated section in “Part 3, Processing Information” and your e-mail address in Part 3 in the blank space underneath the “Phone Number.”\nAdditionally, please make sure that you select the correct location where you will receive your travel documents, as your response to this question will also determine where the U.S. government will collect your biometrics. If you are an entrepreneur, you may select your processing location on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18). If you are the spouse or child of an entrepreneur, you may select your processing location on Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 6)."

		"question": "Q. How is processing affected if I have chosen to receive my parole document at my U.S. mailing address?",
		"answer": "A. If you are in the United States and have opted in Form I-941 to receive your parole document at a U.S. mailing address (Part 1, Item 18), you will receive a notice to appear for a biometrics appointment at an Application Support Center based on your U.S. mailing address (Part 1, Item 19). You must appear for your biometrics appointment for us to consider your Form I-941 application for approval. To avoid delays, please ensure you notify us of any address change within the U.S. by following these instructions. If applicable, please ensure that you include the apartment, floor, or suite number of your U.S. mailing address. Please also provide any “In Care Of Name” information, if any.\nIMPORTANT: If you opted to receive your parole document at your U.S. mailing address, please note that the I-512L Advance Parole document is a secure document that will only be sent to you at the U.S. mailing address you provided in your Form I-941 application.
