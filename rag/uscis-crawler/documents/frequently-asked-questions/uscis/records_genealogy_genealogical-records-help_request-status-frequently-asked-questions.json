The receipt includes the case identification number/Case ID (such as GEN-1000XXXX) and date of submission (open date). You will not receive any additional correspondence from us until we complete your request. Please do not submit a duplicate request on the same immigrant as it only delays your initial request and adds to our backlog.\n\nTo confirm your Genealogy mail requests, we will send you an acknowledgment letter through the U.S. Postal Service to the address provided in your request. The acknowledgment letter will include the date we received your request and the assigned case identification number (such as CMT-1XXXXXXXX). If you do not receive our acknowledgment letter within 20 days, please email us."
