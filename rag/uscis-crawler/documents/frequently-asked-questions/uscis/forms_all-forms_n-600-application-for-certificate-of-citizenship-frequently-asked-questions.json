		"question": "What is Form N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship?",
		"answer": "Form N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship, is filed to obtain a Certificate of Citizenship which serves as evidence of your or your child’s U.S. citizenship. You may file Form N-600 if you were born abroad and are claiming U.S. citizenship at birth through your parents. You may also file Form N-600 to obtain evidence of citizenship if you automatically became a U.S. citizen by operation of law after your birth but before you turned 18 years of age. A parent or guardian may also file Form N-600 on behalf of a minor child.\nPlease note that USCIS does not issue Certificates of Citizenship in cases where the person became a U.S. citizen based on birth in the United States. USCIS only issues Certificates of Citizenship to those individuals who were born abroad but are U.S. citizens at birth through their parents, or who became citizens after birth but before the age of 18.\nFor more information, see USCIS Policy Manual guidance on Children of U.S. Citizens."

		"question": "My U.S. citizen parent(s) is deceased. Does this affect my ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship?",
		"answer": "No. Your parent’s death does not affect your ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship if you automatically acquired citizenship, either at birth or after birth, before your parent’s death. However, if you did not automatically acquire citizenship before your parent’s death, your parent’s death may affect your ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship unless you meet the requirements of section 322 of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA). Please note that section 322 of the INA does not provide for automatic citizenship, but it does allow for naturalization before the age of 18 and allows you to rely on your grandparent’s physical presence instead of your parent’s physical presence."
