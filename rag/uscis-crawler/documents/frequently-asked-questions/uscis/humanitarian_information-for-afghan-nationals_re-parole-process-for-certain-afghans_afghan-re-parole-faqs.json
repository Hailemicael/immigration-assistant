		"question": "Q2. USCIS notified me of my parole extension. Do I need to request a new EAD?",
		"answer": "A. No. For parole extensions, your facially expired c11 EAD, and the Form I-797C that extends your EAD, are proof of identity and employment authorization that you can show your employer for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. However, if you want an updated EAD or if you never had an EAD based on your initial parole, you may submit Form I-765 to USCIS, online or on paper, using category c11. We will exempt the fee to process your Form I-765 as part of this parole extension process, however you must include with your filing a copy of your Form I-797C extending your parole and initial EAD.

		"question": "Q3. Can my employer require me to present an EAD if USCIS extended my initial parole?",
		"answer": "A. No. Your employer is not permitted to request any specific document for Form I-9. That could be unlawful discrimination. Your facially expired c11 EAD, in combination with your Form I-797C extending your EAD, is unexpired proof of identity and employment authorization for your employer for Form I-9. You can find out more information about your rights as an employee and report possible discrimination by visiting the Department of Justice’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section page."

We are considering, on a case-by-case basis, an extension of initial parole for all Afghan nationals who entered the United States on or after July 31, 2021, with an OAR or PAR class of admission who have a pending Form I-589 or Form I-485. You do not need to notify us of your pending application or file a request for an extension of your initial parole.

		"question": "Q5. Will USCIS let me know when you will start to review my initial parole for a possible case-by-case extension for up to 2 years?",
		"answer": "A. No. However, we will contact you on an individual basis if we approve your extension by issuing a Form I-797C notice, extending your initial parole period and EAD. Our goal is to grant parole extensions to those who are eligible as quickly and efficiently as possible."

		"question": "Q7. How soon will USCIS start to send out Form I-797C notices informing Afghan parolees of their case-by-case extension of initial parole?",
		"answer": "A. We began issuing the first notices in July 2023. On a recurring basis, we are identifying individuals who filed Form I-589 and Form I-485 to determine eligibility for extension of their initial period of parole. Please remember, if you have moved, even to a temporary location, you must update your mailing and physical address with USCIS within 10 days of moving.

		"question": "Q: What if an Afghan national under the age of 14 does not have a pending application for re-parole, for asylum, or for a Green Card?",
		"answer": "Answer: DHS is in the process of considering these individuals on a case-by-case basis, for a 2-year extension of their initial period of parole. In particular, those who are eligible for case-by-case consideration of extension of parole include certain Afghan nationals under 14 years old who were paroled into the United States, primarily under Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), with OAR or PAR classes of admission who have not, as of Sept. 26, 2023, filed:\nThis is a vulnerable population due to their age and because many likely are present in the United States without a parent or legal guardian. Many of these Afghan nationals may lack the capacity, access to resources, and general ability to navigate a complex immigration system, and as a result, have not filed Form I-131 (for re-parole), Form I-485, or Form I-589, either directly or through a legal service provider on their behalf. If they do not maintain parole, they will lose their eligibility for essential benefits, such as those offered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement. Losing parole could also mean they fail to maintain a lawful status for purposes of adjusting their status to that of a lawful permanent resident in the future.\nIf we extend an Afghan national’s initial parole period, DHS will update the Form I-94 online to reflect the extended parole period. On CBP’s Form I-94 webpage, individuals can retrieve and download this updated Form I-94 as evidence of their extended parole period. To access the Form I-94, they will need to enter their:\nCBP has instructions on how to look up the most current Form I-94 in English  (PDF), Dari  (PDF), and Pashto  (PDF).\nAfghan parolees may pursue multiple immigration pathways at the same time. This process does not affect other benefit requests, including for Temporary Protected Status or asylum. Note that parole will terminate automatically when a parolee leaves the United States. If a parolee wishes to leave and then return to the United States, they must first apply for advance parole using Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. A previously filed request for re-parole will not be considered a request for an advance parole document."

		"question": "Q2. Is the new re-parole application process the same whether you apply through a USCIS online account or by paper form? For example, will the fee exemption for re-parole and EAD requests apply to both online and paper filings?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Whether you apply for re-parole online or on paper, the streamlined application process is the same and the fee exemption applies. However, by applying for re-parole through a USCIS online account, you can prevent mistakes such as a missing signature, missing pages, or an incomplete application. These are common reasons why we reject some forms filed on paper.\nYou can also access your USCIS online account from your electronic device and submit a form, upload required evidence, and update your address in your account.

		"question": "Q3. Is there a cut-off date for Afghan parolees to file for re-parole under the new fee-exempt application process?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, Afghan nationals with no approved immigration status should file for re-parole before their initial parole expires and from June 8, 2023, through Jan. 31, 2025. If your parole expires, you are no longer in a period of stay authorized unless you have been granted an immigration status such as asylum, lawful permanent resident status, or Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or are otherwise in a period of authorized stay such as having a pending asylum application. If you are granted re-parole, you also remain eligible to receive certain benefits and services funded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). As a reminder, TPS beneficiaries are not eligible for certain statutory Afghan parolee benefits if their parole lapses."

If you have already submitted (or someone else has submitted on your behalf) a Form I-131 to request re-parole before the launch of this new streamlined re-parole process on June 8, 2023, please email HumanitarianParole@uscis.dhs.gov. Please include “Afghan re-parole” and your IOE receipt number in the subject of your email.

		"question": "Q8. Will legal representatives or an accredited representative who assist me with filing my Form I-131 for re-parole need to file a Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative?",
		"answer": "A. If you choose to apply with the assistance of an attorney or accredited representative instead of on your own, the legal representative or accredited representative who assists you must submit a Form G-28 for each family member they represent. Afterward, if you choose to work with another attorney or accredited representative to file for asylum or a Green Card, that attorney may also submit a Form G-28 for those immigration filings. Having multiple Forms G-28 will not impact different filings."

		"question": "Q9. I recently received notification that USCIS rejected my Form I-131 for an incorrect fee. Can you please explain why?",
		"answer": "A. We have seen a slight increase in rejections for a missing fee for Forms I-131 filed on paper with our Lockbox, even though no fee is required for this streamlined process. This is because applicants are not properly listing their class of admission as “OAR” or “PAR.” If you list something other than “OAR” or “PAR,” we will not adjudicate your case under the streamlined process. This means your application may be routed to an incorrect office or we may reject or deny your case. We strongly encourage applicants to submit their re-parole requests through a USCIS online account to reduce filing errors, rejection errors, and processing delays."

		"question": "Q2. Why must children under age 18 have their own USCIS online account?",
		"answer": "A. To file online under the streamlined process for self-petitioners, each applicant must have their own unique email address and account. A parent or legal guardian may create an account for their minor child if the purpose is to submit a form on behalf of the minor.

		"answer": "A. When filing for re-parole through the USCIS online account, parents or legal guardians may sign on behalf of a minor child under the age of 14. Children under the age of 14 may also sign for themselves. If a parent is filling out the information for their child, the parent must fill out the information in the “preparer” section."

		"answer": "Q1. Certain Ukrainian parolees received extensions of initial parole period as noted on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) website. Why is the U.S. government not automatically extending parole for Afghan nationals?\nA. Before the launch of Uniting for Ukraine, certain Ukrainian nationals and their immediate family were paroled into the United States in 2021 during an approximate 8-week period after Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and before the Uniting for Ukraine process became available. These individuals were generally paroled for a period of 1 year, while participants in Uniting for Ukraine received a 2-year period of parole. DHS extended the parole period to make their parole period the same as the 2-year period of parole that parolees under Uniting for Ukraine received. DHS did not automatically grant re-parole to either of these populations. DHS similarly extended the initial parole periods for certain Afghan nationals who received less than 2 years of parole in July 2022."
