	{
		"question": "Can I change to an immigrant or nonimmigrant status?",
		"answer": "At any time during the period of authorized stay, you may apply for classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, if you are eligible. However, as parole is not admission, you would generally be ineligible for adjustment or change of status while in the United States. As a result, if your nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is approved, you may have to depart the United States to apply for a visa based on the petition approval (unless visa exempt) before traveling to a port of entry to request admission into the United States as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable."

		"answer": "If you are currently in the United States in nonimmigrant status, you can apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. If you are not presently maintaining nonimmigrant status you may also apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. However, a failure to maintain your nonimmigrant status may result in immigration consequences including but not limited to removal, inadmissibility, and being barred from adjustment of status in some categories.\nPlease see our International Entrepreneur Rule FAQ page for additional information.\nYou may be eligible for a B-1 visa if you are coming to the United States as a business visitor in order to secure funding or office space, negotiate a contract, or attend certain business meetings  in connection with and prior to opening and operating a new business in this country."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is a short period of time?",
		"answer": "The B-1 nonimmigrant visa category is not meant for extended, long-term activity, but rather for a definite and specific activity. The maximum period of initial admission to the United States as a B-1 nonimmigrant is typically six months, but the actual period of admission will be for a period which is fair and reasonable for completion of the purpose of the visit (and therefore may be less than six months).\nIn no case may the initial period of admission as a B-1 be for more than one year. Extensions of B-1 stay may be available to complete the purpose of your visit to this country. With limited exceptions for certain missionaries, extensions of stay may not be granted in intervals of more than six months each. You must be able to show you have sufficient funds to cover the expenses of the trip and your stay in the United States. You must also show you maintain your residence abroad, which you have no intention of abandoning, and that you have other binding ties which will ensure your return abroad at the end of the visit."

		"answer": "It is permissible to conduct business activities on behalf of a foreign employer, but no salary may come from a U.S. source. In some cases, however, you may receive reimbursement from a U.S. source for reasonable incidental expenses incurred while in the United States.\nNote: There can be no guarantee that the U.S. Department of State (DOS) will issue you a B-1 visa, or that DHS will grant you B-1 status, even if you present the evidence described above.  A consular or DHS officer will consider all the relevant facts before determining whether to issue a visa or grant status.  As such, it is important to fully explain the purpose of your visit or stay and the activities you will be doing, so that DHS (or DOS) can make an informed decision on your application.\nYou may be eligible for an E-2 visa if you invest a substantial amount of money in a new or existing U.S. business. You must be a national of a country that has a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States, a country included in another international agreement authorizing E-2 classification, or a country designated by Congress as eligible for participation in the E-2 nonimmigrant visa program.

		"question": "Can I start and own my own business?",
		"answer": "You may start, own, and work for your own business during your initial period of OPT.\nTo employ an F-1 student with a STEM OPT extension, the start-up entity must meet all regulatory requirements, including that the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains a participant in good standing with E-Verify, will provide compensation to the STEM OPT student commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, and has the resources to comply with the proposed training plan. For instance, alternative compensation may be allowed during a STEM OPT extension if the F-1 student can show that they are a bona fide employee of the employer signing the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, and that their compensation, including any ownership interest in the employer entity (such as stock options), is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers.  While this may not preclude you from having an ownership interest in the start-up, you must be a bona fide employee of the start-up and you may not sign the training plan attestation on your own behalf. For example, certain types of arrangements, including multiple employer arrangements, sole proprietorships, employment through “temp” agencies, employment through consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, and other similar relationships may not be able to demonstrate a bona fide employer-employee relationship and, therefore, may not meet the requirements of the STEM OPT extension. DHS has additional information about starting a business while on OPT and STEM OPT extensions on DHS Study in the States.

If you are authorized to engage in pre-completion OPT, you may not work more than 20 hours per week while school is in session but may work full-time during your annual vacation and other times when the school is not in session. If you engage in pre-completion OPT, your eligible period of post-completion OPT when you graduate will be reduced. If you have already received one year of part-time pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time OPT still available would be reduced by six months, 50% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would only be entitled to a remaining period of six months full-time post-completion OPT. If you have already received one year of full-time pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time OPT still available would be reduced by one year, 100% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would not be entitled to any period of post-completion OPT.\nStudents who graduate with a qualified STEM degree, and are currently in an approved post-completion OPT period based on a designated STEM degree, may apply for a 24-month STEM extension of their post-completion OPT."

Depending upon the content of such documentation, it may establish the employer-employee relationship.\nRequirement 2 – Your job may qualify as a specialty occupation if it meets one of the following criteria:\nNote that “normally,” “common,” and “usually” are interpreted based on their plain language, dictionary definitions. They are not interpreted to mean “always.”"

The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries who have earned a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education (or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities), a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap.\nCap numbers are often used up very quickly, so it is important to plan ahead if you intend to file an H-1B petition that is subject to the annual H-1B numerical allocations. H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, may not be filed unless based on a valid, selected registration for the beneficiary (unless the registration requirement is suspended). Registration typically begins in early March for a start date in the next fiscal year. H-1B petitions can be filed up to six months before the start date.\nThe USCIS website includes several helpful resources, including on the H-1B cap season, the H-1B electronic registration process, and H-1B petitions in general.\nYou may be eligible for an L-1 visa for “intracompany transferees” if you are an executive or manager who has worked abroad for a qualifying organization (including an affiliate, parent, subsidiary or branch of your foreign employer) for at least one year within the three years preceding the filing of your L-1 petition (or in some cases your admission to the United States). To qualify for L-1A classification, the organization must seek to transfer you to the United States to work as an executive or manager.\nYour foreign employer may transfer you to a U.S. entity that is already doing business or you may be transferred to start a new office. This section will only address new offices.\nA new office is an organization that has been doing business in the United States through a parent, branch, affiliate, or subsidiary for less than one year. Because the term organization in the definition of new office is not separately defined, it can be either a U.S. or foreign corporation or other legal entity. The requisite less than one year limitation applies to the new offices that meet any of the four individual entity types – parent, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate. The regulations define a branch as “an operating division or office of the same organization housed in a different location,” illustrating that the organization is not limited to only one location in the United States. Among the factors to be considered are the amount of investment, intended personnel structure, product or service to be provided, physical premises, and viability of the foreign operation.\nFor more information about L-1A intracompany transferees and the differences between the requirements for established offices and new offices, see L-1A Intracompany Transferee and the USCIS Policy Manual.\nRequirement 1 - The U.S. entity must have a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer.\nThe U.S. entity must have a corporate relationship with the foreign entity where you have been employed as a manager or executive. This means that the U.S. entity must be a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or branch of the foreign entity, and that both the U.S. entity and the foreign entity must continue to share common ownership and control. You may still qualify, however, even if the specific foreign entity where you worked abroad for the requisite one year is no longer in operation, provided that there continues to exist at least one other qualifying foreign entity remaining in operation during your entire period of stay in the United States as an L-1A nonimmigrant executive or manager."

This period is limited to one year. After that time, an extension of the L-1 visa is available if the new office meets this requirement of being active and operating. What makes an office active and operating will differ depending on the nature of the business. Typically, it will involve factors such as, but not limited to, hiring additional employees, fulfillment of contract orders, having a revenue stream, or holding inventory, if applicable.\nRequirement 4 - After one year, the new office must support a managerial or executive position if you are requesting an extension of stay in the L-1A classification.\nDuring the first-year ramp up, a manager or executive may be required, as a practical matter, to engage in many “hands-on” tasks that go beyond inherently managerial or executive tasks. After the first year, however, you will be required to focus primarily on managerial or executive tasks and demonstrate that the business now supports a managerial or executive position in order to obtain an extension of the L-1 visa."

Extraordinary ability means you have a level of expertise indicating you are one of the small percentage of people who have risen to the very top of your field.\nRequirement 1 – A U.S. employer or U.S. agent must file the petition.\nUSCIS regulations provide that the petitioner may be either a U.S. employer or U.S. agent (who may be the actual employer of the beneficiary, the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or a person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent). While O-1 beneficiaries may not self-petition, a separate legal entity you own (such as a corporation or limited liability company) may file a petition on your behalf.\nRequirement 2 - You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.\nThe O-1A classification, for those in the sciences, business, education, or athletics, is for people who are among a small percentage at the very top of their field and who are coming to the United States to continue work in that field of expertise.\nTo establish eligibility for classification as an O-1A nonimmigrant, you must provide initial evidence that you either have received a major, internationally recognized award, or submit initial evidence that satisfies at least three of the eight evidentiary criteria.\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how O-1A eligibility is evaluated, including a chart (reproduced below) that describes relevant examples of evidence that may satisfy each of the alternate O-1A evidentiary requirements, as well as considerations that are relevant to evaluating such evidence.\nExamples:\n Considerations:\n While many scholastic awards do not have the requisite level of recognition, there are some Ph.D. scholarships or dissertation awards, for example, that are nationally or internationally recognized as awards for excellence such that they may satisfy the requirements of this criterion. Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to:\nFor example, an award available only to persons within a single locality, employer, or school may have little national or international recognition, while an award open to members of a well-known national institution (including an R1 or R2 doctoral university) or professional organization may be nationally recognized.\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nThe petitioner must show that membership in the association requires outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought, as judged by recognized national or international experts.\nAssociations may have multiple levels of membership. The petitioner must show that to obtain the level of membership afforded to the beneficiary, the beneficiary was judged by recognized national or international experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought.\nAs a possible example, membership in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at the IEEE fellow level requires, in part, that a nominee have “accomplishments that have contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science and technology, bringing the realization of significant value to society,” and nominations are judged by an IEEE council of experts and a committee of current IEEE fellows. As another possible example, membership as a fellow in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is based on recognition of a nominee’s “significant, sustained contributions” to the field of artificial intelligence, and is judged by a panel of current AAAI fellows.\nRelevant factors that may lead an officer to a conclusion that the person's membership in one or more associations was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the person's membership was based:\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nPublished material that includes only a brief citation or passing reference to the beneficiary’s work is not “about” the beneficiary, relating to the beneficiary’s work in the field, as required under this criterion. However, the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work in the field and mentions the beneficiary in connection to the work may be considered material “about” the beneficiary relating to their work.\nMoreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the beneficiary is a member, provided that the material mentions the beneficiary in connection with the work, or other evidence in the record documents the beneficiary’s significant role in the work or research.\nIn evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the relative circulation, readership, or viewership (for major trade publications and other major media).\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nThe petitioner must show that the beneficiary has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the beneficiary actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization.\nFor example, a petitioner might document a beneficiary’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to the beneficiary to do the review, accompanied by evidence confirming that the beneficiary completed the review.\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nAnalysis under this criterion focuses on whether the beneficiary’s original work constitutes major, significant contributions to the field.\nEvidence that the beneficiary’s work was funded, patented, or published, while potentially demonstrating the work’s originality, will not necessarily establish, on its own, that the work is of major significance to the field. However, published research that has provoked widespread commentary on its importance from others working in the field, and documentation that it has been highly cited relative to other works in that field, may be probative of the significance of the beneficiary’s contributions to the field of endeavor.\nSimilarly, evidence that the beneficiary developed a patented technology that has attracted significant attention or commercialization may establish the significance of the beneficiary’s original contribution to the field. If a patent remains pending, USCIS will likely require additional supporting evidence to document the originality of the beneficiary’s contribution.\nDetailed letters from experts in the field explaining the nature and significance of the beneficiary’s contribution(s) may also provide valuable context for evaluating the claimed original contributions of major significance, particularly when the record includes documentation corroborating the claimed significance.\nSubmitted letters should specifically describe the beneficiary’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise.\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nTo meet this criterion, the beneficiary must be a listed author of the submitted article(s) but need not be the sole or first author. In addition, a petitioner need not provide evidence that the beneficiary’s published work has been cited to meet this criterion.\nIn addition, the articles must be scholarly. In the academic arena, a scholarly article reports on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse. It is written by a researcher or expert in the field who is often affiliated with a college, university, or research institution and the article is normally peer-reviewed.\nIn general, it should have footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography, and may include graphs, charts, videos, or pictures as illustrations of the concepts expressed in the article. In non-academic arenas, a scholarly article should be written for learned persons in that field.\nIn evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the circulation, readership, or viewership relative to other media in the field (for major trade publications and other major media).\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nTo show a critical role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary has contributed in a way that is significant to the organization or establishment’s activities. To show an essential role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary’s role is (or was) integral to the entity. A leadership role in an organization often qualifies as critical or essential.\nFor a supporting role to be considered critical or essential, USCIS considers other factors, such as whether the beneficiary’s performance in the role is (or was) integral or important to the organization or establishment’s goals or activities, especially in relation to others in similar positions within the organization.\nIt is not the title of the beneficiary’s role, but rather the beneficiary’s duties and performance in the role that determines whether the role is (or was) critical or essential. Detailed letters from persons with personal knowledge of the significance of the beneficiary’s role can be particularly helpful in analyzing this criterion. The organization need not have directly employed the beneficiary.\nIn addition, the organization or establishment must be recognized as having a distinguished reputation. Relevant factors for evaluating the reputation of an organization or establishment can include the scale of its customer base, longevity, or relevant media coverage.\nFor academic departments, programs, and institutions, officers may also consider national rankings and receipt of government research grants as positive factors in some cases.\nFor a start-up business, officers may consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders commensurate with funding rounds generally achieved for that start-up’s stage and industry, as a positive factor regarding its distinguished reputation.\nExamples:\nConsiderations:\nIf the petitioner is claiming to meet this criterion, then the burden is on the petitioner to provide appropriate evidence establishing that the beneficiary’s compensation is high relative to others working in similar occupations in the field. The following webpages, among others, may be helpful in evaluating the relative compensation for a given field:\nOfficers should evaluate persons working outside of the United States based on the wage statistics or comparable evidence for that locality, rather than by simply converting the salary to U.S. dollars and then viewing whether that salary would be considered high in the United States.\nFor entrepreneurs or founders of start-up businesses, officers consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders in evaluating the credibility of submitted contracts, job offer letters, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for services.\nNote: If any of the criteria discussed in the Appendix chart do not readily apply to your occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. When the required initial evidence has been provided, USCIS will evaluate the totality of the evidence to determine eligibility.\nThe Policy Manual also includes guidance regarding the use of comparable evidence to establish eligibility, as well as the guidance regarding how USCIS evaluates the totality of the evidence for O-1A petitions.\nRequirement 3 – You must show that you will continue to work in your area of expertise.\nYou are required to provide copies of any written contracts between you and the petitioner/start-up entity. If there is no written contract, you may provide a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which you will be employed. In addition, you must provide an explanation of the nature of the events or activities, which may include your employment, in the United States.\nRequirement 4 – You must obtain an advisory opinion from an appropriate peer group.\nThe advisory opinion must be written by an individual or group with expertise in your field regarding the nature of your work and your qualifications. The consultation should describe your ability and achievements in your field."
