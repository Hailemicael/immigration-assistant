		"question": "A. What Is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals?",
		"answer": "As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to focus its enforcement resources on those who pose the greatest threat to homeland security, DHS will exercise prosecutorial discretion as appropriate to ensure that enforcement resources are not expended on individuals who do not fall into this category, such as individuals who came to the United States as children and meet other key guidelines. Individuals who demonstrate that they meet the guidelines below may request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal for a period of 2 years, and may be eligible for employment authorization.\nWe may approve a request for DACA only if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you meet each of the following threshold criteria and merit a favorable exercise of discretion:\nWere under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the time of filing your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012, and at the time you filed your request for DACA, meaning that:\nYou never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012*, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired on or before June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise terminated before you submitted your request for DACA;\nAre currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.\n* Please review Q19 below if you are currently in a lawful immigration status.\nYou may call us at 800-375-5283 with questions or to request more information on DACA. If you have a pending request, we have online self-help tools you can use to check your case status and processing times, change your address, and send an inquiry about a case pending longer than posted processing times or about non-delivery of a card or document."

		"question": "Q1: What is deferred action?",
		"answer": "A1: Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For purposes of future inadmissibility based on prior periods of unlawful presence in the United States, an individual is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period when deferred action is in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.  Deferred action recipients are also considered to be lawfully present as described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi) for purposes of eligibility for certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) during the period of deferred action. However, deferred action does not confer lawful immigration status upon an individual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence they may have.\nUnder 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33), an individual who has been granted deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21 through 236.23, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, may receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action, provided they can demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.”\nUnder 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at the agency’s discretion. Please see Q28 for more information."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q2: What is DACA?",
		"answer": "A2: On June 15, 2012, the secretary of homeland security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several key guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal, and, if approved, will then be eligible for work authorization if they can demonstrate economic necessity. On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS issued the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Rule to preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. The final rule is effective as of Oct. 31, 2022.\nIndividuals who can demonstrate through verifiable documentation that they meet these guidelines will be considered for deferred action. We will make determinations on a case-by-case basis under the DACA final rule.\nAll guidance in these FAQs stems from the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q3: I currently have DACA. How does the DACA Final Rule impact me?",
		"answer": "A3: If you are a current DACA recipient, your grant of deferred action and related work authorization, as well as any DACA advance parole document issued, will remain in effect and will expire according to their existing terms. Any requests for renewals of those grants are now governed by the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 and not the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q4: Is there any difference between “deferred action” and DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?",
		"answer": "A4: DACA is a form of deferred action. The relief an individual receives with a grant of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is identical for immigration purposes to the relief obtained by any person who receives deferred action as an act of prosecutorial discretion."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q5: If my removal is deferred under the DACA final rule, am I eligible for employment authorization?",
		"answer": "A5: Yes. Under the regulations at 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33) if you receive DACA under the DACA final rule, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided you can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q6: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral?",
		"answer": "A6: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence (for admissibility purposes) during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful immigration status.\nThe fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change that you are in unlawful status while you remain in the United States. However, although deferred action does not confer a lawful immigration status, you may stay in the United States while your deferred action is in effect. For admissibility purposes, you will not accrue “unlawful presence” while you have deferred action. You are also considered to be “lawfully present” in the United States while you have deferred action for purposes of certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) as described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi). Federal law does not prevent individuals granted deferred action from establishing domicile in the United States.\nApart from the immigration laws, “lawful presence,” “lawful status” and similar terms are used in various other federal and state laws. For information on how those laws affect individuals who receive a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA, please contact the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities.\nNote: It is a federal crime for an alien who is “illegally or unlawfully in the United States,” among others, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. See 18 U.S. 922(g)(5)(A). This prohibition applies to DACA recipients."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q7: Can I renew my period of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA?",
		"answer": "A7: Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of your DACA. We will consider your request for a renewal on a case-by-case basis under 8 CFR 236.22-23. If we renew our exercise of discretion under DACA for your case, you will receive deferred action for another 2 years, and if you show an economic necessity for employment, you may receive employment authorization for that period.\nReturn to top."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q8: How do I request consideration of DACA?",
		"answer": "A8: To request consideration of DACA (either as an initial request or to request renewal), you must submit Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to USCIS. Please visit the Form I-821D webpage before you begin the process to make sure you are using the most current version of the form available. You must complete this form, sign the form, and include the required filing fee. With Form I-821D you must also submit Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, the required Form I-765 filing fee, and Form I-765WS, Worksheet, establishing your economic need for employment. You can find the filing fees for Forms I-821D and I-765 by vising our Fee Schedule page. If you fail to submit a completed Form I-765 (along with the worksheet and accompanying filing fees for that form, please see the Form I-821D page for more information), we will not consider your request for deferred action. Please read the form instructions to ensure you answer the appropriate questions (determined by whether you are submitting an initial or renewal request) and that you submit all the required documentation to support your initial request.If you are making an initial DACA request, you must file your request for consideration of DACA at the USCIS Lockbox. You can find the mailing address and instructions on the Form I-821D webpage. After we receive your Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765 Worksheet, we will review them for completeness, including submission of the required fee, initial evidence and supporting documents (for initial filings). Pursuant to current court orders, we are accepting initial DACA requests but cannot adjudicate them at this time. If you are submitting a renewal DACA request, you may file your request at the USCIS Lockbox or online.\nInstructions for Online Filing (DACA Renewal Requests Only)\nDACA recipients may submit a DACA renewal request online. To file Form I-821D and Form I-765 online, you must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit Form I-821D, Form I-765 and Form I-765WS, pay fees, and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to create an account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to communicate with USCIS through a secure inbox and respond online to Requests for Evidence. For additional information on filing a DACA renewal request online, see the Form I-821D webpage. To be considered for DACA, you must submit Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS with your online DACA renewal requests.\nAfter You Submit Your Request\nIf we determine your request is complete, we will send you a receipt notice. If you need to visit an Application Support Center (ASC) for biometric services, we will send you an appointment notice. Please make sure you read and follow the instructions in the notice. If you fail to attend your biometrics appointment, it may take longer for us to process your request for consideration of deferred action, or we may deny your request. You may also choose to receive an email or text message or both notifying you that we have accepted your form by completing a Form G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance.\nWe will review each request for consideration of DACA on an individual, case-by-case basis. We may request more information or evidence from you or ask you to appear at a USCIS office. We will notify you of our determination in writing.\nNote: All individuals who believe they meet the guidelines, including those in removal proceedings, with a final removal order, or with a voluntary departure order, may affirmatively request consideration of DACA from USCIS through this process. If you are currently in immigration detention and believe you meet the guidelines, you may request consideration of deferred action from USCIS, but we will not approve the request until you are released from detention. If you are requesting DACA, you should tell your deportation officer or follow directions at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) DACA webpage, which also has more information."

		"question": "Q9: Can I obtain a fee waiver or fee exemption for this process?",
		"answer": "A9: There are no fee waivers available for DACA requests or employment authorization applications connected to DACA. There are very limited fee exemptions available for Form I-821D and related Form I-765s. You must file a request for a fee exemption, and we must approve your request, before you file your Form I-821D and Form I-765 without fees.

		"question": "Q33: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?",
		"answer": "A33: To meet the continuous residence guideline under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(2), you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence.\nIt is helpful for us if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation for certain periods may raise doubts about your continued residence if they are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period that was not brief, casual or innocent.\nIf gaps in your documentation raise questions, we may issue a Request for Evidence(RFE) to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence.\nYou may submit affidavits to explain a gap in the documentation showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period when there is a gap in the documentation. You may only use affidavits to explain gaps in your continuous residence; you cannot use them as evidence that you meet the entire 5-year continuous residence requirement."

Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.\nDACA recipients may submit a DACA renewal request online. To file Form I-821D and Form I-765 online, a DACA requestor must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit forms, pay fees and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to set up an account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to communicate with USCIS through a secure inbox and respond online to Requests for Evidence. For additional information on filing a DACA renewal request online, go to the Form I-821D webpage. All online DACA renewal requests must include Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS and accompanying fees.\nUSCIS’ current goal is to process DACA renewal requests within 120 days. You may submit an inquiry online about the status of your renewal request after it has been pending more than 105 days. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to:If you fail to appear at an ASC for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. It will take longer to process your request if you miss or reschedule your appointments;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orA renewal submission that is incomplete or contains evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines and we must request additional evidence or an explanation."

		"answer": "A53: We strongly encourages you to file your renewal request within the recommended 120- to 150-day filing period to minimize the possibility that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. We will accept requests we receive earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expires; however, this could result in an overlap between your current DACA and your renewal. This means your renewal period may extend for less than a full 2 years from the date that your current DACA period expires.\nIf you file less than 120 days before your current period of DACA expires, there is more risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. If you file after your most recent DACA period expires, but within 1 year of its expiration, you may submit a request to renew your DACA. If you are filing beyond 1 year after your most recent period of DACA expired, or if your most recent grant of DACA was terminated at any time, you may still request DACA by submitting a new initial request.\nPlease note: An ongoing July 16, 2021, injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and, on Oct. 14, 2022, was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect and prohibits DHS from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. Due to the partial stay of the injunction, DHS presently may grant DACA renewal requests under the final rule."

Generally, we will only issue an advance parole document if you want to travel outside the United States for:\nHumanitarian purposes, including to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit an ailing relative;Educational purposes, such as semester abroad programs and academic research; orEmployment purposes, including but not limited to overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or training, consular appointment for an employer-sponsored nonimmigrant visa, or meetings with clients overseas.\nTravel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole.\nTravel for educational purposes means travel affiliated with an institution that provides education as its primary purpose. You do not have to be enrolled in the institution that the program is affiliated with, but you must be enrolled in the program you will be traveling with.\nYou may not apply for an advance parole document unless and until we approve your DACA request. If you are submitting a DACA renewal request, you may apply for advance parole at the same time; however, there is a separate filing address for advance parole requests, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will consider all advance parole requests on a case-by-case basis.\nWe strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.\nIf we have granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above.\nCAUTION: If you have been ordered deported or removed, before you leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the EOIR and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, you may be considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you have any questions about this process, you may contact ICE through the local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor with jurisdiction over your case."

		"question": "Q61: What happens to my DACA grant if I leave the United States without advance parole?",
		"answer": "A61: CAUTION: When you leave the United States, you are no longer in a period of deferred action. DACA recipients who leave the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States. We strongly encourage you to obtain an advance parole document before you leave to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.\nWe may terminate a grant of DACA, in our discretion and after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond, for DACA recipients who depart from the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document and subsequently enter the United States without inspection. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(2). Generally, a recent entry without inspection will be a significant negative factor warranting termination of DACA as a threat to border security, but where there are exigent circumstances, such as accidental or involuntary border crossings, DHS may choose to continue exercising prosecutorial discretion and allow the grant of deferred action to continue.\nDACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining advance parole but who are paroled into the United States may resume their DACA upon expiration of the period of parole."

This is different from the language on your advance parole document that authorizes a departure and reentry between specified dates. Please review your advance parole document carefully to understand the details of your travel authorization."

However, unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt continuous residence, regardless of whether it was otherwise brief, casual, and innocent. Your absence from the United States will be considered brief, casual, and innocent if it was on or after June 15, 2007, and before Aug. 15, 2012, and:\nThe absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings; andThe purpose of the absence and your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law.\nOnce we have approved your request for DACA, you may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States.\nCAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without authorization and subsequently enter without inspection, DHS will issue you a Notice of Intent to Terminate and may, barring exigent circumstances, terminate your deferred action under DACA in its discretion,\nTravel Guidelines (Chart #2)Travel DatesType of TravelDoes It Affect Continuous ResidenceOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012Brief, casual and innocentNoFor an extended timeBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, voluntary departure, or removalTo participate in criminal activityYesOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACAAnyYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case, and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.In addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACAAnyOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACAAnyIt depends. If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, if you travel without authorization, the travel will interrupt your continuous residence."

However, the filing addresses for a DACA renewal request and an advance parole request are different, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will not issue an advance parole document for a period that continues past your DACA validity period.\nWe strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires.

Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b).\nWe have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole.
