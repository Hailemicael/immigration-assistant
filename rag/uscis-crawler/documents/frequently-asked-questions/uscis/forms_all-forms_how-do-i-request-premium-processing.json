		"question": "Can the beneficiary of a visa petition seek premium processing?",
		"answer": "No, except in cases where the petitioner is eligible to file a self-petition (that is, the petitioner and the beneficiary are the same). Otherwise, only the petitioner (or the attorney or representative who has filed Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, on behalf of the petitioner) may request premium processing for a designated petition. While the petitioner, beneficiary, attorney, or representative, however, may pay the premium processing service fee, the beneficiary cannot sign or file Form I-907."

		"question": "How do I verify that I am using the current version of the form?",
		"answer": "Check the Edition Date section of our Form I-907 webpage for information on the current edition date."
	},
	{
		"question": "How do I file a request for premium processing?",
		"answer": "As the petitioner or applicant (or attorney or representative), you must complete and sign Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, according to the instructions on the current version of the form. If you are filing Form I-907 together with Form I-129 or Form I-140, you must file both forms according to the Form I-129 instructions or Form I-140 instructions based on the form that you filed.\nIf you have already filed Form I-129 and you now wish to request premium processing:\nIf you have already filed Form I-140 and you now wish to request premium processing:\nFor Form I-140 and I-129 petitions that are filed together with Form I-907, we will reject both the underlying petition and request for premium processing if they are not filed at the correct location. The filing location is based on the underlying petition. A listing of those locations can be found on either the I-129 or I-140 Direct Filing Addresses webpage.\nFor Form I-140 petitions we will not reject any standalone Form I-907 that is mistakenly filed at a service center without geographic jurisdiction over the underlying Form I-140 petition. We will reject any standalone I-907 filed at a Lockbox, because it was not filed at the correct location.  For incorrectly filed Forms I-907, the premium processing time period begins on the date the correct service center receives the file, as indicated in the Form I-907 filing instructions.\nFor Form I-129 petitions, we will reject any standalone Form I-907 that is not filed at the correct location listed on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, webpage. The underlying petition’s current location may not be the same as the proper filing location on this webpage. Once we receive the Form I-907 at the proper location as listed on the Direct Filing Addresses webpage, we electronically match the Form I-907 to your Form I-129 petition.\nIf you are an F-1 student and you have already filed Form I-765 requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension and you now wish to request premium processing, file Form I-907 online or with the Chicago Lockbox.\nFor Form I-765: (c)(3)(A), (c)(3)(B), (c)(3)(C) requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension, Form I-907 will be rejected if the application is not an eligible category for premium processing or if we are not able to match your Form I-907 with the receipt for your Form I-765 requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension. Furthermore, if you submit a single payment for concurrent fillings, we will reject the forms for improper fee payment.\nSince June 13, 2023, USCIS has been accepting Form I-907 requests filed via paper form or online, for nonimmigrants who have a pending Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, and requested a change of status to one of the following:\nIf you already submitted Form I-539 to request a change of status to one of these classifications, and you want to request premium processing, file Form I-907 online or on paper with the appropriate Lockbox.  You must file Form I-907 the same way you submitted Form I-539 (online or via paper form.)\nSince June 26, 2023, has been accepting Form I-907 requests filed via paper form or online, for applicants seeking to change into F-1, F-2, M-1, M-2, J-1, or J-2 status, when filed together with their Form I-539.\nFor Form I-539 requesting a change of status to F-1, F-2, M-1, M-2, J-1, or J-2 status, Form I-907 will be rejected if the application is not an eligible category for premium processing or if we are not able to match your Form I-907 with the receipt for your Form I-539 requesting a change of status.\nPlease note that when requesting premium processing, either by filing the Form I-907 together with the eligible form (such as Form I-140 or I-129) or for a previously filed eligible form, you must submit only one Form I-907 for the one eligible form or classification.  Do not submit unrelated Forms I-907 in the same envelope. This will delay the processing of your request.\nFor example, if you are filing a Form I-140 and seek premium processing for that Form I-140, you would submit the Form I-140 with Form I-907.  However, do not submit multiple Forms I-907 for the same Form I-140 and do not include Forms I-907 for other Forms I-140 that you might have submitted previously. This will delay the processing of your request."

		"question": "Can I file a premium processing request online?",
		"answer": "Only certain F-1 students seeking OPT or STEM OPT extensions, or applicants requesting a change of status to F-1, F-2, M-1, M-2, J-1, or J-2 nonimmigrant status, may file Form I-907 online at this time. If you file a paper Form I-907, or any other USCIS form, you can create an online account to track the status of your case and sign up for case notifications.\nTo file Form I-907 online, you must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit forms, pay fees, and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to set up a USCIS online account, which offers a superior user experience over paper filing.  If you have previously filed a USCIS form online, you may use your existing USCIS online account.\nDue to limitations with the online Form I-907, representatives who previously filed a Form G-28 will need to file a new Form G-28 when requesting premium processing. Representatives who prefer not to file Form G-28 online must file their premium processing request and Form G-28 with the appropriate lockbox."
	},
	{
		"question": "Is USCIS placing any conditions of availability on premium processing for Form I-140 petitions?",
		"answer": "Yes. Premium processing is available for the Form I-140 classifications indicated on the charts above. Please review to determine your eligibility to either upgrade a pending E13 multinational executive and manager or E21 NIW petition, or to submit an initial E13 multinational executive and manager or E21 NIW petition. (Please see “How do I file a request for premium processing?” section, above, for how info on how to upgrade)."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is the fee for this service?",
		"answer": "For information on the current filing fee, see our Fee Schedule.\nFee waivers not available: USCIS fee waiver regulations at 8 CFR 106.3(a) do not provide for a Fee Waiver for Form I-907."
	},
	{
		"question": "Does this program have any effect on USCIS’ previous expedite practices?",
		"answer": "Yes. In general, discretionary expedite requests will no longer be available for classifications designated as eligible for premium processing. However, petitioners designated as not-for-profit entities by the IRS have the choice to request discretionary expedited service as they have in the past, or they may choose to pay the premium processing service fee and use that service. If the not-for-profit entity doesn’t meet the criteria for a discretionary expedite, the petitioner may still request premium processing by filing Form I-907 and paying the fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "How will USCIS manage those categories that have an annual limit in relation to this faster processing?",
		"answer": "Those who pay for premium processing on petitions filed for nonimmigrant classifications that are subject to annual numerical (“cap”) limits will not have an unfair access to these limited immigration programs.\nIf necessary, we will apply a random selection process to all petitions received on the final receipt date for cap-subject H-2B and H-3 petitions, regardless of whether premium processing is requested. We will adjudicate these randomly selected cases and will reject and return the fees for any unselected cases, as well as cases that were filed after the final receipt date.\nIf necessary, for the H-1B cap, we will apply a random selection process to all registrations received during the initial registration period or final registration date. If we suspend the registration process, we will apply a random selection process to all petitions received on the final receipt date for cap-subject H-1B petitions, regardless of whether premium processing is requested. If the final receipt date is any of the first five business days on which petitions subject to the H-1B regular cap may be received (i.e., if the cap is reached on any one of the first five business days that filings can be made), we will randomly select from among all the petitions properly submitted during the first five business days the number of petitions deemed necessary to meet the H-1B cap. In either scenario, we will adjudicate these randomly selected petitions and will reject and return the fees for any unselected petitions, as well as petitions that were filed after the final receipt date."

		"question": "Can I contact a USCIS service center if I have not filed a request for premium processing but have questions about the program?",
		"answer": "Once you have filed Form I-907 for your underlying Form I-129, Form I-140, Form I-765, or Form I-539, you may contact the service centers directly. Please note that the toll-free number and email address listed on the receipt notice for the Form I-907 are only for users who have already submitted a request for premium processing. If you have not requested premium processing service, you can call 800-375-5283 for general information about the program.\nCustomer service is a top priority for USCIS, and we remain committed to ensuring that applicants and petitioners have timely, meaningful access to assistance and resources. If you have not filed your Form I-907, or have other case-related questions, we offer a number of customer service tools that you may find helpful."

	{
		"question": "How do I contact the service center concerning a premium processing service request that I filed?",
		"answer": "If you have already filed Form I-907 and you need to contact the service center, call 866-315-5718. Be sure to have your receipt number ready. If you filed your Form I-907 online for a Form I-765 requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension, you may send a secure message through your USCIS online account."
	},
	{
		"question": "Will USCIS also expedite my Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, if I submit it with my Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker?",
		"answer": "Premium processing is not available for Form I-539 applications filed for dependents of a Form I-129 beneficiary classification. However, applications for change of status or extension of stay properly filed together with a Form I-539 for derivative H-4 or L-2 status will be adjudicated at the same time as the principal’s Form I-129. This means that an officer will review the H-4 or L-2 derivative’s Form I-539 as soon as possible after reviewing the principal’s Form I-129 and will take appropriate adjudicative action (that is, issue an approval, denial, RFE, NOID or refer for an investigation) after that adjudicative review when the derivative’s Form I-539 is packaged together with and properly filed at the same time and in the same location as the principal’s Form I-129. Individuals applying for other classifications may request expedited processing on a case-by-case basis. For more information, please see our Options for Terminated Workers page and How to Make an Expedite Request page."
