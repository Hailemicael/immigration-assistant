		"question": "Q. Are There Any Mandatory Bars to Establishing a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture?",
		"answer": "A. No. There are no mandatory bars to establishing a credible fear or persecution or torture. However, there are mandatory bars to asylum and withholding of removal. An asylum officer does not make a final decision whether you are subject to a mandatory bar to asylum or withholding of removal in the credible fear determination process. An asylum officer will note in their credible fear decision that a mandatory bar to asylum or withholding of removal may apply in a subsequent Asylum Merits Interview before an asylum officer or in immigration proceedings before an IJ.\nYou may not be granted asylum or withholding of removal if:\nYou have persecuted others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion;You have been convicted of a particularly serious crime;There are serious reasons for believing you committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States;You have engaged in terrorist activity, are likely to engage in terrorist activity, have incited terrorist activity, or are a member or representative of a terrorist organization;You were firmly resettled; orThere are reasonable grounds to believe that you are a danger to the security of the United States.\nSee Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sections 208(b)(2)(A) and 241(b)(3)(B) and 8 CFR 208.16(d). If a mandatory bar applies, but you establish that it is more likely than not that you would be tortured if removed to the country of proposed removal, the IJ will grant you deferral of removal. See 8 CFR 208.17."

		"question": "Q. What Will Happen if an Asylum Officer Finds I Have a Credible Fear?",
		"answer": "A. If an asylum officer finds that you have a credible fear of persecution or torture, USCIS may either:\nRetain and consider your application for asylum and also consider your eligibility for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) in a second interview. This is known as an Asylum Merits Interview. An asylum officer will decide whether you are eligible for asylum. If necessary, an asylum officer will also determine whether you demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT based on the record before USCIS; orIssue a Notice to Appear before an IJ for consideration of your asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection claims. When you file Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, with the immigration court, it places you in the “defensive” asylum process.\nFor more information, see the Obtaining Asylum in the United States and Asylum Merits Interview with USCIS: Processing After a Positive Credible Fear Determination pages."

		"question": "Q. What Will Happen if USCIS Retains my Asylum Application After an Asylum Officer Finds I Have a Credible Fear?",
		"answer": "A. The written record of your positive credible fear determination will be treated as your application for asylum. Therefore, you do not need to file Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal.\nYou will be scheduled for a non-adversarial Asylum Merits Interview with an asylum officer to establish that you are eligible for asylum. At your Asylum Merits Interview, an asylum officer will consider whether you are barred from a grant of asylum. If necessary, an asylum officer will also determine whether you demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT based on the record before USCIS.\nFor more information, see the Obtaining Asylum in the United States and Asylum Merits Interview with USCIS: Processing After a Positive Credible Fear Determination pages."

		"answer": "A. You may apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under CAT before the IJ by filing Form I-589. The burden of proof is on you to establish that you are eligible for asylum or other protection in the United States.\nThe IJ will consider whether you are barred from a grant of asylum or withholding of removal. If a bar applies, but you established that you would be tortured in the country of return, the IJ will grant deferral of removal."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What Will Happen if an Asylum Officer Does Not Find a Credible Fear?",
		"answer": "A. If an asylum officer finds you do not have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you can request review by an IJ. If you do not request a review of the negative determination, or if an IJ affirms the negative credible fear determination, ICE may remove you from the United States. Generally, there is no review of the IJ’s determination that you do not have a credible fear of persecution or torture.\nIf an IJ finds that you have a credible fear of persecution or torture and vacates the asylum officer’s negative credible fear determination:\nYour case may be referred back to and accepted by USCIS for an Asylum Merits Interview; orYou may be issued a Notice to Appear before an IJ for consideration of your asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection claims.\nFor more information, see the Obtaining Asylum in the United States and Asylum Merits Interview with USCIS: Processing After a Positive Credible Fear Determination pages."
