		"question": "Q1. I am currently outside the United States. Can I request re-parole under this re-parole application process?",
		"answer": "No. Only certain Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members already in the United States may apply for re-parole under this application process. Any prior period of parole will terminate automatically when an alien leaves the United States.\nUkrainian citizens and their immediate family members outside the United States may apply for parole under U4U. Beneficiaries are eligible for this process if they:\nNote: To be eligible for this process, children under the age of 18 must be traveling to a U.S. port of entry in the care and custody of their parent or legal guardian. Parents and children who are not residing in the same country before travel may still be able to use this process.\nThe supporter must complete and file Form I-134A with USCIS and be vetted by the U.S. government to protect against possible exploitation and abuse and to ensure that they are able to financially sustain the Ukrainians they are agreeing to support."

		"question": "Q2. Is the re-parole application process for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members the same whether you apply through a USCIS online account or on paper?",
		"answer": "Yes. Whether you apply for re-parole online or on paper, the application process is the same. However, by applying for re-parole through a USCIS online account, you can avoid mistakes such as a missing signature, missing pages, or an incomplete application. These are common reasons why we reject some forms filed on paper.\nYou can also access your USCIS online account from your electronic device and submit a form, upload required evidence, and update your address in your account. If you do not complete your form immediately, it will be saved in draft form for 30 days. You can view case status, case history, and documents uploaded to support your case, as well as notices we post to your account, such as biometrics scheduling, receipt notices and requests for evidence. We have resources in Ukrainian and resources in Russian to help guide you through the steps to set up your free USCIS online account.\nNote, however, that if you are submitting Form I-912 to request a waiver of the Form I-131 filing fee, you cannot apply online. You can only request a fee waiver if you apply on paper."

	{
		"question": "Q3. Is there a date by which Ukrainian parolees and their immediate family members should file for re-parole?",
		"answer": "Yes. If your parole has not been terminated, and we have not changed or adjusted your immigration status, you should apply for re-parole before your initial parole period expires. We encourage eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to submit their re-parole requests to us no earlier than 180 days (6 months) before the expiration of their current period of parole. You can find your parole expiration date on your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you were paroled into the United States.\nFiling during this window reduces the risk that your current period of parole and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your re-parole request. If you submit a request for re-parole more than 180 days before the expiration of your current period of parole, we may reject or deny your re-parole application without refunding the filing fees. Please note that filing earlier than 180 days before your current parole expiration date will not result in a faster decision.\nIf your parole period expires, you are no longer in a period of authorized stay unless you have been granted an immigration status such as asylum, lawful permanent resident status, or Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or are otherwise in a period of authorized stay such as having a pending asylum application. If your parole period expires, you may no longer be employment authorized unless you have been granted an immigration status that allows you to work, or you have a basis to seek employment authorization based on another immigration category."

		"question": "Q4. What is USCIS doing to expedite the processing of re-parole applications from eligible Ukrainian citizens and their family members?",
		"answer": "We aim to quickly adjudicate all Form I-131 requests for re-parole filed by eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members. Eligible applicants should apply for re-parole as soon as possible because unexpected delays can affect the timely adjudication of their re-parole application. Typos, errors, an incomplete application, or lack of required documentation can slow down the processing of re-parole applications. We encourage eligible parolees to apply for re-parole using the USCIS online account to reduce the occurrence of such errors that could delay processing."

	{
		"question": "Q5. Will my legal representative or accredited representative who helps me file Form I-131 for re-parole need to file a Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative?",
		"answer": "Yes. If you choose to apply with help from an attorney or accredited representative, the legal representative or accredited representative who assists you must submit a Form G-28 for you and each family member they represent. Afterward, if you wish to have a different attorney or accredited representative receive notices or communicate about your case with USCIS, they must submit a separate Form G-28. If you choose to file for another immigration benefit with the help of an attorney or accredited representative, that attorney must also submit a Form G-28 for those immigration filings. Having multiple Forms G-28 will not affect different filings."

		"question": "Q6. How should I list my mailing and physical addresses if my mailing address is different from my physical address",
		"answer": "Currently, Form I-131 only allows individuals to list 1 address. To ensure proper delivery of notices and other documents, please list your mailing address in the physical address fields.\nAs a reminder, if you move, you must update your address with USCIS through your USCIS online account or by submitting Form AR-11, Alien’s Change of Address Card. We have tutorial videos showing you how to update your address through your account and how to submit Form AR-11 online. Report your new address to USCIS within 10 days each time you move, even if you are moving to a temporary location.\nIf you have not reported your change of address within 10 days of your move, you must still update your address with USCIS as soon as possible. Please remember that changing your address with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or another U.S. government agency will not change your address with USCIS. Please update your information with both USCIS and USPS if you move."

	{
		"question": "Q7. If I have applied for or received Temporary Protected Status, do I need to file for re-parole?",
		"answer": "If you have been granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but you have not obtained any other status and you remain an “applicant for admission,” you may apply for re-parole, but you are not required to apply for re-parole. You may want to consult with an immigration attorney or accredited legal representative to determine what is best for your particular situation."

		"answer": "No. There is also a paper-filing option to apply for re-parole. For more information about how to file on paper, visit our Re-Parole Process for Certain Ukrainian Citizens and Their Immediate Family Members page. However, we encourage you to file through your USCIS online account. Filing online will help you avoid common mistakes such as a missing signature, missing pages, or an incomplete application.

		"question": "Q11. Can an individual establish a single USCIS online account and apply on behalf of their family members, so families can apply together, like in other parole processes?",
		"answer": "No. Under this process, each family member, including children under age 18, must have their own USCIS online account and file as a self-petitioner."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q12. Do children under age 18 need to have their own USCIS online account to apply for re-parole online under this process?",
		"answer": "Yes. Each individual must file their own re-parole application under the process for certain Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members, regardless of age. To file online as a self-petitioner, each applicant must have their own unique email address and USCIS online account. A parent or legal guardian may create an account for their minor child if they need to submit a form on behalf of the minor. If a parent or legal guardian is not available, a primary caregiver or legal assistance provider may also assist a child with a Form I-131 application to apply for re-parole. If a parent, legal guardian, or other provider is preparing Form I-131 on behalf of a minor, the minor should be listed as the self-petitioner and the person completing the form should fill out their information in the “preparer” section."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q13. If I am applying for re-parole for a child under the age of 14, is there anything I should do differently than I would for an applicant age 14 or older?",
		"answer": "When applying for re-parole, parents or legal guardians may sign for a minor child under the age of 14, although a minor under 14 may also sign for themselves. Children over the age of 14 should generally sign for themselves, if they are able to do so. If a parent or legal guardian is filling out the information for their child, the parent or legal guardian must fill out their information in the “preparer” section."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q14. I have applied for re-parole for my child under 14 years old. How should I sign my name on the online form for my child?",
		"answer": "If you sign for a child as their parent or legal guardian, you should sign your own name, with a notation that you are signing “for” or “on behalf of” the child. You should also include the child’s name. Minors may sign an application for themselves, if they are able to. If a parent signs for a minor child, the parent must submit a birth certificate or adoption decree to establish the parent-child relationship. A legal guardian may also sign for a child who is under 14 years old, as well as for a mentally incompetent person of any age. We require documentation to establish a legal guardian’s authority to sign a benefit request for a child or mentally incompetent requestor. Acceptable documentation includes, but is not limited to, official letters of guardianship or other orders issued by a court or government agency legally authorized to make such appointment under the law governing the place where the child or incapacitated requestor resides. See PM Vol 1, Part B, Chapter 2 for additional information."

		"question": "Q15. Do parents or legal guardians need to provide any different or additional evidence for children under 14 years old?",
		"answer": "Each individual must file their own re-parole application under this process, regardless of age. A parent or legal guardian may complete the application for a minor under 14 years old seeking re-parole, by signing for the minor and providing evidence of the legal relationship, such as a birth certificate. A legal guardian may also sign on behalf of a mentally incompetent person of any age. We require documentation to establish a legal guardian’s authority to sign a benefit request on behalf of a child or mentally incompetent requestor.

		"question": "Q16. Do I need to apply for a new EAD to continue working if I am granted a new period of parole?",
		"answer": "Yes. If we approve your application for re-parole, you may file Form I-765 through your USCIS online account. Do not file your Form I-765 before we approve your re-parole application. Eligible parolees will receive an EAD that they can present to their employers for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification.\nIf you receive a Form I-131 approval notice showing a new period of parole, visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Form I-94 website to view and print a copy of your new Form I-94, which should reflect an updated “class of admission” of “UHP.”\nIf you are granted re-parole, your unexpired Form I-94, which includes a UHP class of admission and a “Most Recent Date of Entry” on or before Sept. 30, 2024, authorizes you to work for 90 days without an approved Form I-765. The updated I-94 serves as an acceptable List A receipt that shows your identity and employment authorization for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. The receipt satisfies the Form I-9 requirement for 90 days from the date of hire (or in the case of reverification, the date employment authorization expires).\nAfter the 90-day period, parolees must present to their employer an unexpired EAD, or unrestricted Social Security card and acceptable List B identity document from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents (such as a state-issued driver’s license or identification card). USCIS will provide additional guidance to employers about completing Form I-9."

		"answer": "Wait until after we approve your re-parole application to file Form I-765 in category (c)(11) to apply for a new EAD as evidence of employment authorization for a period consistent with your re-parole period. Do not file Form I-765 before you receive a re-parole approval notice. If you file Form I-765 before we approve your re-parole application, we may deny your Form I-765, and we will not refund the fee.\nYou can file Form I-765 either online or by mail on paper. You can use your USCIS Online Account to file Form I-765. If you request a fee waiver request for Form I-765, you must file Form I-765 by paper. You cannot apply for an EAD online if you are requesting a fee waiver."

When you submit Form I-765, to apply for a new EAD, you must include either:\nThe filing fee; or\nA completed and signed Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver.\nIf you submit a fee waiver request, you must file Form I-765 on paper.

		"answer": "Yes, but as part of the re-parole application, you should submit Form I-131 with the correct spelling of your name. In addition, you will need to submit government-issued evidence, such as a passport, showing the correct spelling of your name. You must also include an English translation of the government-issued evidence if it is a document in a language other than English."

We also consider many factors when we prioritize adjudication of applications for re-parole, including the urgency of the request and the initial parole period expiration date.\nFiling online using the USCIS online account can help reduce processing time in general because you will not have to mail a form to USCIS and you will be able to access notices and upload required information more quickly.

These individuals were generally paroled for a period of 1 year, while participants in Uniting for Ukraine received a 2-year period of parole. As a matter of discretion, DHS extended the initial parole periods for the former group of parolees, on a case-by-case basis, to match the 2-year period of parole granted to parolees under Uniting for Ukraine.

They can only continue to work without a new EAD for up to 90 days from the date of hire (or in the case of reverification, the date employment authorization expires). This applies to aliens who were paroled into the United States on or before Sept. 30, 2024, and have a “UHP” class of admission on their Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.\nIf you are one of these parolees, then after we grant re-parole, you can download and print an updated Form I-94 from U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) I-94 website that will show both the “Most Recent Date of Entry” and class of admission. If the Form I-94 shows the “Most Recent Date of Entry” is Sept. 30, 2024, or earlier and the “UHP” class of admission, you can use the unexpired Form I-94 as an acceptable List A receipt that shows your identity and employment authorization for up to 90 days for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification purposes.\nNote: Parolees should provide their downloaded and printed electronic Form I-94 available from the CBP I-94 website to their employers and not the tear-off Form I-94 found on the Form I-131 re-parole approval notice. The information on the tear-off Form I-94 does not contain the most recent date of entry.\nYou must get an EAD because within 90 days, these parolees must present an unexpired EAD, or unrestricted Social Security card and acceptable List B identity document from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents (such as a state-issued driver’s license or identification card) to continue to work."

		"answer": "Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members paroled into the United States who are approved for re-parole are not eligible for a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or identification card because parole is not included in the REAL ID Act  (PDF) as a category of aliens authorized to receive a REAL ID-compliant license or identification card. However, parolees with another eligible category covered under the REAL ID Act, such as an approved or pending application for TPS or asylum, can potentially qualify for a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or identification card.\nNote: Many driver’s license issuing authorities allow parolees to apply for a driver’s license or ID card that is valid, but may not be REAL ID-compliant.\nFor more information, please see REAL ID Frequently Asked Questions and guidance from the Department of Motor Vehicles for the jurisdiction where you live."
