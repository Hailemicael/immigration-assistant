For more information on state and local courts, contact the state or county historical or genealogical society in the location where you believe the immigrant naturalized. For federal court records, contact the National Archives and Records Administration.\nFor more information on arrival and nationality records dated prior to Sept. 27, 1906, visit our Research Guidance page."
