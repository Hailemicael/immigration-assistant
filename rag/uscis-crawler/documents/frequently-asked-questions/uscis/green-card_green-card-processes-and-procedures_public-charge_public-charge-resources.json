		"question": "Q: What is the public charge ground of inadmissibility?",
		"answer": "A: Congress established that an alien application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status can be denied if they are found “likely at any time to become a public charge.”\nFor DHS, a public charge inadmissibility determination is based on an alien’s likelihood of becoming primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.\nUSCIS must apply this public charge inadmissibility determination to most aliens who are applying for lawful permanent residence (also known as a Green Card) when we adjudicate Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.\nAs explained in detail below, some aliens are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: How does USCIS administer the public charge ground of inadmissibility?",
		"answer": "A: For adjustment of status applications postmarked (or electronically filed, if applicable) on or after Dec. 23, 2022, USCIS will apply the 2022 Final Rule. For applications postmarked before Dec. 23, 2022, USCIS will administer the public charge ground of inadmissibility consistent with the statute and the 1999 Interim Field Guidance."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Who is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility?",
		"answer": "A: The following aliens are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility when applying for visas, admission, or adjustment of status:\nFor further information on which categories of aliens are subject to and exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 8, Part G, Chapter 3 and 8 CFR 212.23."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What are the factors that USCIS will consider when making a public charge inadmissibility determination?",
		"answer": "A: For all applicants for adjustment of status who are subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility, USCIS must consider the statutory minimum factors of age; health; family status; assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills. The applicant provides relevant information about these factors as part of the adjustment application (Form I-485) and the Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693).\nUSCIS will favorably consider a sufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ), if required.\nUSCIS will also consider any current and/or past receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Which public benefits does USCIS consider when determining whether an applicant is inadmissible under the public charge ground?",
		"answer": "A: We consider an applicant’s current and/or past receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance. Public cash assistance for income maintenance includes only the following:\nWe also consider an applicant’s institutionalization for long-term care at government expense, such as in a nursing home or mental health institution.\nHowever, relatively few applicants will be both subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and eligible for these public benefits prior to adjustment of status. (For more details, see below under “Most Aliens Are Not Eligible for Public Benefits.”)"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What public assistance programs does USCIS not consider?",
		"answer": "A: Generally, we do not consider noncash benefits in making public charge determinations. The only noncash benefit we consider is long-term institutionalization at government expense. We also do not consider special-purpose cash assistance that is not intended for income maintenance.\nFor example, USCIS does not consider any of the following public benefits when making a public charge determination:\nNutrition programs\nHealth programs\nHousing programs\nEducation and childcare programs\nDisaster relief programs\nEarned benefits\nOther public benefits"

		"question": "Q: Who is subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and eligible for the public benefits considered under the 2022 Final Rule?",
		"answer": "A: Relatively few aliens in the United States are both subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and eligible for the public benefits considered under the 2022 Final Rule before adjustment of status.\nThe following table identifies the major categories of aliens who are generally subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and may be eligible for the federal public benefits considered under the 2022 Final Rule (such as Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Medicaid that supports aliens who are institutionalized for long-term care at government expense). The 2022 Final Rule also includes consideration of state and local cash assistance programs that provide benefits for income maintenance (often called ‘‘General Assistance’’ programs); and any other program in addition to Medicaid that supports aliens who are institutionalized for long term care at government expense. (The table does not include these programs).\nThe 2022 Final Rule, the public charge inadmissibility determination is a prospective determination based on the totality of the alien's circumstances (that is, we weigh all the information and evidence relevant to the statutory factors as applied to an applicant’s case). No one factor serves as the sole criterion for making a public charge inadmissibility determination (except for an insufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA where required).\nThe table is provided for background purposes only and should not be used to determine eligibility for public benefits.\nSSI eligibility only in limited circumstances.¹\nMedicaid and TANF eligibility subject to 5-year waiting period in most cases.\nSSI eligibility only in limited circumstances.¹\nNot subject to the public charge inadmissibility ground if also in an exempt immigration status.²\nAbbreviations: SSI, Supplemental Security Income; INA, Immigration and Naturalization Act; LPR, lawful permanent resident (or “Green Card” holder); TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; U.S.C., United States Code.\n¹ See Social Security Administration, Supplemental Security Income for Alien , https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-11051.pdf (accessed Feb. 9, 2022).\n² Certain aliens are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, including but not limited to:\nFor further information on which categories of aliens are subject to and exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 8, Admissibility, Part G, Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility and the 2022 Final Rule [PDF  (PDF)].\n³ USCIS does not consider any public benefits that were received by aliens  who, while not refugees, are eligible for resettlement assistance, entitlement programs, and other benefits available to refugees. For example, Congress explicitly extended benefits normally reserved for refugees to our Afghan allies and to certain Ukrainians impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What if a family member living in the adjustment applicant’s household uses public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense? Would that count against the applicant’s immigration status or eligibility for immigration benefits?",
		"answer": "A: No. The receipt of public benefits by an applicant’s family members is not considered in a public charge inadmissibility determination under the 2022 Final Rule. Only public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense provided to the applicant, where the applicant is listed as a named beneficiary, are considered in a public charge inadmissibility determination."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Does the receipt of public benefits by someone who naturalized or derived U.S. citizenship affect their citizenship?",
		"answer": "A: No. Anyone who naturalized or derived U.S. citizenship cannot lose their citizenship because of receipt of public benefits while a U.S. citizen."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Are lawful permanent residents subject to a public charge inadmissibility determination when they apply to renew their Green Cards?",
		"answer": "A: No. Lawful permanent residents applying to renew their Green Card are not subject to a public charge inadmissibility determination, because they are not required to establish that they are admissible to the United States to renew their Green Card."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Does the receipt of public benefits by a lawful permanent resident affect their immigration status while they are in the United States?",
		"answer": "A: No. DHS only applies the public charge ground of inadmissibility to applicants for admission to the United States or to applicants for adjustment of status who are already in the United States. Lawful permanent residents have already adjusted their status."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What if a lawful permanent resident has received or is receiving public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense and departs the United States—will they be subject to a public charge determination upon their return?",
		"answer": "No, except in a few unusual circumstances. DHS does not typically treat a lawful permanent resident who has been outside the United States as an applicant for admission when they return from a trip abroad and, therefore, they would not generally undergo a public charge inadmissibility determination upon their return. Under INA 101(a)(13)(C), an LPR returning from a temporary trip abroad would only be considered seeking admission to the United States if any of the following factors apply:"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Does the current and/or past receipt of public benefits automatically result in an applicant being found likely at any time to become a public charge?",
		"answer": "A: No. USCIS considers current and/or past receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term institutionalization at government expense in the totality of the circumstances, taking into account the amount, duration, and recency of the receipt.  Current and/or past receipt of these benefits alone is not a sufficient basis to determine that an applicant is likely at any time to become a public charge.\nThe past or current receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term institutionalization at government expense is only one factor we consider in the totality of the circumstances; other factors include the statutory minimum factors (age; health; family status; assets, resources, financial status; and education and skills) and the Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, if required.\nUSCIS will not find an applicant inadmissible on the public charge ground solely based on an applicant’s disability."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What if an alien receives public benefits while in a category that is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, but then applies to adjust status while in a non-exempt category?",
		"answer": "USCIS does not consider any public benefits received by a alien during periods in which the alien was present in the United States in an immigration category that is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility or for which the alien received a waiver of public charge inadmissibility.\nFor example, an individual with refugee status is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility and may be eligible for a range of public benefits, including public cash assistance for income maintenance. If this individual later applied for adjustment of status based on a family petition (Form I-130), they would be subject to a public charge determination, but their receipt of public benefits during their period of refugee status would not be considered."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Will receiving free COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, or treatment be used in determining whether someone is likely to become a public charge?",
		"answer": "A: No. We do not consider public assistance for immunizations and for testing and treating communicable diseases. We do not consider receipt of Medicaid and other public health insurance and health services. This includes health clinics, short-term rehabilitation services, and emergency medical services.\nWe encourage everyone, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and subsequent booster vaccines. We also encourage everyone, including aliens, with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, shortness of breath) to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services. Such treatment or preventive services will not affect any public charge determination, now or in the future."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What about other COVID-19 public assistance, such as for food, housing, cash assistance, rental assistance, tax credits, stimulus payments, unemployment, financial aid grants to students, Paycheck Protection Program, and student loan forbearance?",
		"answer": "A: We do not consider such public assistance that is specifically related to COVID-19, because these are noncash benefits or special-purpose cash benefits that we do not use in making public charge determinations as a general matter. We only consider Supplemental Security Income (SSI), cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and General Assistance (in other words, cash assistance provided by states or localities), as well long-term institutionalization provided at government expense.\nStates have flexibility in administering the TANF program and may choose to provide noncash assistance such as subsidized childcare or transportation vouchers in addition to cash assistance. Such noncash benefits are not considered for public charge purposes. States may also provide nonrecurrent cash payments for specific crisis situations under TANF. These payments are not considered for public charge purposes because they are not cash for income maintenance."

	{
		"question": "Q: What is an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA?",
		"answer": "A: Congress amended INA 212(a)(4) in 1996 to require that certain immigrants submit a sufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ), executed by a sponsor, to avoid a finding of inadmissibility under this section. The new section, INA 213A, specifies who meets the definition of a sponsor, which immigrants must submit a sufficient Affidavit of Support, the scope of a sponsor’s obligations, and how an Affidavit of Support may be enforced.\nBy executing an Affidavit of Support, a sponsor creates a contract between the sponsor and the U.S. government. Under this contract, the sponsor agrees:\nReceiving means-tested public benefits does not disqualify someone from becoming a sponsor. However, means-tested public benefits cannot be included as income that is used to meet the income threshold."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Which applicants for adjustment of status must submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA?",
		"answer": "A: Most family-based applicants for adjustment of status must submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ), executed by a sponsor, who is usually the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident who filed the immigrant petition on the adjustment applicant’s behalf. Employment-based applicants for adjustment of status must submit Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ if the applicant’s U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative (as defined in 8 CFR 213a.1) filed the employment-based immigrant petition, or has a significant ownership interest in the entity that filed the immigrant visa petition on behalf of the applicant."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Which applicants for adjustment of status do not have to submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA?",
		"answer": "A: Applicants for adjustment of status who do not have to submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ) include applicants in the following categories:\nFor further information on which applicants for adjustment of status do not have to submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 8, Admissibility, Part G, Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility."

	{
		"question": "Q: What is the purpose of Form I-864W, Request for Exemption for Intending Immigrant's Affidavit of Support, and who may submit this form instead of Form I-864?",
		"answer": "A: The Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ) is required for most family-based immigrants and some employment-based immigrants to show that they have adequate means of financial support and are not likely to become a public charge. Certain classes of immigrants are exempt from the Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ requirement but must submit Form I-864W, Request for Exemption for Intending Immigrant's Affidavit of Support with their adjustment of status application to establish that a Form I-864 is not required in their case.\nApplicants for adjustment of status who must submit Form I-864W include applicants who:"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: What is the effect of a missing or an insufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, when one is required?",
		"answer": "A: If an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ) is required but not submitted, or if we deem the Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ insufficient because the sponsor failed to demonstrate the means to maintain income at the required threshold, the intending immigrant is inadmissible on the public charge ground and we will deny the intending immigrant’s application for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: When does DHS make public charge inadmissibility determinations?",
		"answer": "A: In general, all grounds of inadmissibility apply to immigration benefits that require that an applicant is admissible to the United States. Specifically, the public charge ground of inadmissibility applies to applicants for visas, admission, and adjustment of status, unless the alien is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility. Most commonly, we make public charge inadmissibility determinations as part of the adjustment of status application process (Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) when aliens apply to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident. U.S. Customs and Border Protection makes public charge inadmissibility determinations when applicants for admission who are subject to this inadmissibility ground present themselves for inspection at a port of entry."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: How is the Department of State addressing public charge inadmissibility determinations during consular processing of immigrant visa applications?",
		"answer": "A: Please refer to the Department of State’s Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) at 9 FAM 302.8 for information about public charge determinations made in consular processing of immigrant visa applications."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: Is the public charge ground of inadmissibility a consideration when determining a person’s eligibility to file an immigrant petition on behalf of a relative?",
		"answer": "A: No. The public charge ground of inadmissibility does not apply to immigrant petitions on behalf of a relative (Form I-130)."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: INA 213 states that aliens inadmissible only based on the public charge ground may be admitted in the discretion of DHS “upon the giving of a suitable and proper bond or undertaking.” What policies and procedures does USCIS have in place to implement this section of law?",
		"answer": "A: DHS regulations implementing the public charge bond provisions are available in 8 CFR 103.6 and 8 CFR 213.1. Additionally, USCIS’ policies and procedures on public charge bonds are found in the USCIS Policy Manual."
