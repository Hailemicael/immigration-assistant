    "question": "What’s the difference between a Fiancé(e) Visa and a Marriage-Based Green Card?",
    "answer": "A Fiancé Visa is for a U.S. citizen’s fiancé who is a foreign citizen currently living outside the United States. Many U.S. citizens have traveled and developed a relationship with a foreign individual whom they hope to marry.\n\nAt present, these individuals may request a K-1 Fiancé Visa to allow their intended spouses to come to the United States to marry. Permanent residents (green card holders) may not petition for a Fiancé Visa. These individuals, however, may choose to marry abroad and would be eligible to petition for their new spouse to move to the United States."

    "question": "What Kinds Of Questions Will They Ask You At The Green Card Marriage Interview?",
    "answer": "Because the USCIS official interviewing you has to make sure your marriage is valid, you may have to answer questions about your relationship during your green card marriage interview. If you’re in a bona fide marriage, the interview will probably not be an issue for you – the questions aren’t incredibly complicated, but they do require you to know enough about your spouse to prove that you’re together as a couple.\n\nYou’ll want to provide the USCIS officer with proof of your “togetherness,” such as receipts for rent or mortgage payments, bills with both of your names on them, pictures of you two together, and other evidence that you have.\n\nIf the official handling your case doesn’t believe that you’re in a genuine marriage, he or she may ask questions about your relationship in what’s known as a Stokes Interview. Those types of interviews include things like:\n\nWhen and where did you meet?\nHow often do you go out to eat?\nHow is your living room set up?\nWhat does your spouse eat for breakfast?\nWhat kind of nightly routine do you have before you go to bed?\nWhat kinds of entertainment do you both enjoy?\nWhat cell phone provider does your spouse use?"

  {
    "question": "What Is A Marriage Green Card With Conditions (Conditional Permanent Residency (CR-1))?",
    "answer": "A green card you obtain through marriage is nearly the same as any other green card; the key difference is that it comes with conditions attached. You can still live and work anywhere in the United States with a green card – you’ll be a conditional permanent resident. The conditions apply to people who have been married for fewer than two years. (If you’ve been married for longer, you won’t have conditions attached to your green card.)\n\nAll this really means is that you’ve been married for fewer than two years – and once you’ve been married for two years, the U.S. government can remove the conditions. You must petition the government to remove the conditions by using Form I-751, which your immigration attorney can fill out and file for you. Timing matters; your lawyer must file your I-751 during the 90-day window before your conditional permanent residency expires. If you file too early, the government will return your petition, and if you file too late, it’ll reject it entirely (unless you can explain valid reasons why it’s late).\n\nWhat do you need to prove in a conditional permanent residency? - CR-1\nThe form is a joint petition, which means both you and your spouse will have to sign it. You’ll also need to include evidence that you’re in a bona fide marriage, which means that you’re in the marriage for valid reasons (rather than simply married to obtain an immigration benefit, which can get you deported). By the time you file your I-751, you’ve been married for more than two years, so USCIS expects there to be real evidence of your marriage, such as:\n\nPhotos of you and your spouse together\nJoint financial documents\nLeases or mortgage statements with both of your names on them\nChildren’s birth certificates\nOther types of proof are also acceptable, and your Dallas immigration attorney can talk to you about what needs to accompany your petition.\n\nIt’s really important to note that even if you’re a conditional permanent resident, you have all the same rights and responsibilities that any other permanent resident has – you just have to petition the government to remove the conditions after you’ve been married long enough. If you don’t remove the conditions on your permanent residency, you’ll be “out of status.” That means you can be removed from the country because as soon as your conditional permanent residency expires, you’re in the United States illegally."

  {
    "question": "What Happens If You Get Divorced After Receiving A Green Card?",
    "answer": "Green card holders are usually unaffected by a divorce when they file another application or petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) if they are already a lawful permanent resident with a 10-year green card.\n\nIf a person obtained their green card by marrying a U.S. citizen and their marriage was less than 2 years old at the time of approval, then getting a divorce might cause some complications. In cases where the marriage was less than 2 years old at the time of approval, USCIS will issue a conditional green card that is valid for two-years. During the 90 days prior to the expiration of the green card, the Permanent Resident must file an application to remove the conditions (Form I-751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence) as well as supplemental evidence to prove the bona fides of the marriage. This application should be filed jointly with the spouse through which the residency was obtained. In cases of divorce, the green card holder cannot file jointly and must file with a waiver request."

It is during this interview that applicants discuss their cases with a government official, known as an “asylum officer.” This official will talk with you and discuss the experiences that led you to flee your home and seek asylum in the U.S. While recounting such life events will likely be stressful and upsetting, it is absolutely necessary to convince the interviewer that you are a candidate for asylum.\n\nYou can prepare for the interview by readying the following documents and materials, which need to be brought to your interview:\n\nI-94 Arrival Record(s)\n\nBirth and/or Marriage Certificates\n\nPassport(s), as well as any other ID/travel documents\n\nA hard copy of your I-589 asylum application\n\nIf you submitted paperwork petitioning for a spouse or children, they should come to the interview with you. Additionally, they will need to provide any paperwork discussed above that is applicable, like their passport and ID. Additionally, if your travel, ID, and other documents/evidence are not in English, you will need to bring certified translations of those documents. You can read more about specific required documentation on the USCIS’s website.\n\nDue to the complex nature of asylum proceedings and interviews, all applicants have the right to bring an attorney to their asylum interview.

    "question": "Can I apply for a green card if i have criminal record?",
    "answer": "The most obvious bar to immigrating to the United States is a criminal record. Not all crimes have immigration consequences, but any encounter with law enforcement will have to be documented before a green card would be granted. Any drug-related offense, other than one offense for simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is likely to result in a permanent bar to a green card.\n\nAny offense deemed a “crime involving moral turpitude” may also result in a bar with the exception of a petty offense for a relatively minor misdemeanor. Other offenses that may result in a bar to obtaining a green card include prostitution, drug and people trafficking.\n\nNon-drug related offenses that do not involve moral turpitude, such as disorderly conduct and strict liability crimes, or crimes of negligence, generally will not have immigration consequences. Under current law, driving under the influence or while intoxicated generally does not factor into a green card decision.\n\nAlso, attempts and conspiracy to commit crimes count as though they were the crimes themselves and potentially carry the same consequences. Finally, a plea of guilty or no contest and punishment are equal to a finding of guilt for immigration consequences, even if the criminal case is ultimately dismissed.\n"

Always adhere to U.S. tax laws to avoid penalties in the future. \n\nSpecial Cases\n\nIf an individual with an ITIN forms an LLC, you can pay them as a business entity, using 1099 payments for their work.
