		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

	{
		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. When was the last time USCIS increased fees?",
		"answer": "A. We published our previous fee schedule in a fee rule  (PDF) that went into effect more than 7 years ago, on Dec. 23, 2016."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

		"question": "Q. If forms are postmarked by March 31, 2024, will the current (pre-April 1) USCIS fees apply, even if USCIS does not receive the forms before April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. The correct fee and form version is based on the postmark date of the filing, not the date that we receive it. Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055. We encourage you to use the online filing option when it is available."

	{
		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

A new edition of the USCIS Pre-Order Instructions is on our Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page."

	{
		"question": "Q. What happens to online filers after April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

You can see a comprehensive list of fees by viewing, Fee Schedule, Form G-1055.\nIn addition, our online fee calculator is available to determine the current fee for any form processed at a USCIS lockbox facility (which is the great majority of our forms)."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. Where can I find the 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines?",

We will no longer publish the guidelines in Form I-912P or Form I-942P. However, we have created a new webpage containing Poverty Guidelines information, including  household income relevant for fee waivers and fee reductions based on a filer’s location, household size, and current U.S. Department of Health and Human Service guidelines."

		"question": "Q. I am applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted. Should I submit my application through the PDF filing option?",
		"answer": "A.  If you are applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted, you should not submit your application through the PDF filing option at this time. If you file a Form I-765 for the (c)(9) category via the PDF filing option, you must pay a fee or submit a request for a fee waiver."

		"question": "Q. If a fee waiver is requested using an older version of Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, will USCIS still adjudicate the request and, if so, under which fee waiver rules? For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

		"question": "Q. If USCIS rejects a fee waiver request, and the application is resubmitted with the fee payment, will the receipt date be the date of the fee waiver submission or the date of the fee payment?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",

	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

		"question": "Q. What proof is needed to show the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",

		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor.

We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee.

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",
		"answer": "A. No. You do not need to file Form I-912 with applications that are fee-exempt."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

		"question": "Q. The instructions for Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, imply that Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, would not be fee exempt for those adjusting status under VAWA or as a T or U nonimmigrant. Is that correct?",
		"answer": "A. No. As discussed further below, Form I-485 is fee exempt for applicants seeking to adjust status as VAWA self-petitioners and for those applying under INA 245(l) (T nonimmigrants) or INA 245(m) (U nonimmigrants)."

		"question": "Q. Do the humanitarian fee exemptions for Form I-131, listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b), apply if a person in a qualifying category files Form I-131 on behalf of someone else? For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",
		"answer": "A. If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

		"answer": "A. See Forms Available to File Online for a complete list."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."
	},

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"question": "Q. As additional forms become available for online filing, will they also receive the online filing discount?",
		"answer": "A. In general, yes. However, certain forms will not receive the online filing discount when they become available for online filing, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount. Such future online forms include:"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",
		"answer": "A. No. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process multi-form submissions. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

	{
		"question": "Q. How do I pay the Asylum Program Fee? Is there a separate form or paperwork?",
		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. In general, yes, you must pay the Asylum Program Fee for each Form I-129 filed, including for initial grants, extensions, and changes of employer. As discussed further below, small employers pay a reduced Asylum Program Fee, and nonprofits do not pay the fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: May a beneficiary pay the Asylum Program Fee, or must it be the petitioner who pays?",
		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

	{
		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},

		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

		"question": "Q. Must a petitioner submit evidence of nonprofit status with each Form I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-140?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, the petitioner must demonstrate eligibility for fee reductions and exemptions in every submission, as with the substantive requirements for the underlying benefit."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How can I determine what fees to pay and what discounts are available when filing Form I-129 or Form I-140?",
		"answer": "A. A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",
		"answer": "A. The limit on named beneficiaries for Form I-129 applies regardless of the type of petitioner."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",
		"answer": "A. You may submit multiple petitions in one mailing if you file them on paper."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Are all supporting documents (such as cover letter, itinerary, evidence for the classification) that is based on the group, not individual members, filed alongside each Form I-129, or is one Form I-129 designated the primary petition?",
		"answer": "A. When petitioning for more than 25 named beneficiaries, the employer must submit copies of all supporting documentation with each separate petition."

	{
		"question": "Q. Please clarify whether the Form I-129 petition fee includes the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) and Fraud Prevention Fees. If not, have these fees changed?",
		"answer": "A. The ACWIA and Fraud Prevention Fees are separate and in addition to the main fee and the Asylum Program Fee for Form I-129. These longstanding statutory fees have not changed."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect O nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."
	},

		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect P nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For P nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,015. However, the fee only increases to $510 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

		"answer": "A. Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

		"question": "Q. Will there be a fee exemption for biometrics based on age?",
		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS determines that I am not eligible for a reduced Form N-400 fee, can I submit the difference in filing fee to prevent the application from being rejected?",

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice. The validity period for approvals is 15 months from the approval date."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

	{
		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What proof is needed to show the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Such redaction is permissible when the evidence is only to support eligibility for a reduced fee and the redacted information is not otherwise relevant to the adjudication."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

		"question": "Q. For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. How will small farmers who do not file IRS Forms 941 or 943 demonstrate that they are eligible for the half-price Asylum Program Fee for petitioners who are small employers?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"question": "Q. When a petitioner is an agent or sponsoring organization, not the beneficiary’s employer, can they be eligible for a reduced Form I-129 fee and reduced Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Do beneficiary-owners pay the discounted fee for Form I-129?",
		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

The fee rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners, who are not required to pay the Asylum Program Fee.\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofit employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. For the precise discounted fees, please see the full fee schedule, Form G-1055.\nOn Form I-140, select Yes in Part 1, Question 5, if you are a nonprofit organization.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization (or Part 5, Question 8 on Form I-129CW)."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. When was the last time USCIS increased fees?",
		"answer": "A. We published our previous fee schedule in a fee rule  (PDF) that went into effect more than 7 years ago, on Dec. 23, 2016."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

		"question": "Q. If forms are postmarked by March 31, 2024, will the current (pre-April 1) USCIS fees apply, even if USCIS does not receive the forms before April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. The correct fee and form version is based on the postmark date of the filing, not the date that we receive it. Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055. We encourage you to use the online filing option when it is available."

		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

A new edition of the USCIS Pre-Order Instructions is on our Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page."

		"question": "Q. What happens to online filers after April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues.

There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

Please see our Filing Fees page for more details.\nIf you are submitting one of the following forms, the required fees depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer.\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker:\nPart 1, Question 6 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 7 of the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 15 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 6 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 14 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 15, and you answer Question 14 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker:\nPart 1, Question 8 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer.

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants.

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled. This means that if you file Form I-485 on or after April 1, 2024, you will have to pay separate fees for Forms I-131 and I-765.\nThe new fee for Form I-131 when seeking advance parole is $630.\nThe new fee for Form I-765 is $470 (online filing) or $520 (paper filing).

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

	{
		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

	{
		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",

	{
		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

		"answer": "A. No. As discussed further below, Form I-485 is fee exempt for applicants seeking to adjust status as VAWA self-petitioners and for those applying under INA 245(l) (T nonimmigrants) or INA 245(m) (U nonimmigrants)."

For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",
		"answer": "A. If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing.

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. What if the IRS has not officially approved an organization’s nonprofit status?",
		"answer": "A. An organization may still qualify if it is a governmental research organization or an educational institution as described above. Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

		"question": "Q. Must a petitioner submit evidence of nonprofit status with each Form I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-140?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How can I determine what fees to pay and what discounts are available when filing Form I-129 or Form I-140?",
		"answer": "A. A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",
		"answer": "A. The limit on named beneficiaries for Form I-129 applies regardless of the type of petitioner."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",
		"answer": "A. You may submit multiple petitions in one mailing if you file them on paper."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Are all supporting documents (such as cover letter, itinerary, evidence for the classification) that is based on the group, not individual members, filed alongside each Form I-129, or is one Form I-129 designated the primary petition?",
		"answer": "A. When petitioning for more than 25 named beneficiaries, the employer must submit copies of all supporting documentation with each separate petition."

		"question": "Q. Please clarify whether the Form I-129 petition fee includes the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) and Fraud Prevention Fees. If not, have these fees changed?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect O nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect P nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For P nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,015. However, the fee only increases to $510 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"question": "Q. What is the Form N-400 reduced fee amount?",
		"answer": "A. The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

		"answer": "A. Yes. An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"question": "Q. Can I file Form N-400 online and request a fee reduction in Part 10 of the N-400?",
		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

		"question": "Q. If an applicant uses Form I-942 during the grace period, will USCIS still apply the new income limits when adjudicating a request for a reduced N-400 fee?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

		"question": "Q. What documentation should N-400 applicants submit to establish household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines to obtain a reduced fee?",

According to the Form N-400 instructions, you may show your income or that of a household member by submitting the most recent federal tax return, consecutive pay statements for at least one month, a recent Form W-2, Form SSA-1099, or an employment statement showing salary or wages paid."

		"question": "Q. Will the lockbox facilities continue to adjudicate reduced fee requests?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. The lockbox facilities will continue to adjudicate any reduced fee request before the case is sent to a field office for the naturalization adjudication. Just as adjudicators previously had access to Form I-942, they will have access to the reduced fee request in Part 10 of the new Form N-400."

		"question": "Q. Will there be a fee exemption for biometrics based on age?",
		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS determines that I am not eligible for a reduced Form N-400 fee, can I submit the difference in filing fee to prevent the application from being rejected?",

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

Are these payments considered when the fees were changed, or do I have to repay these fees when a final decision on my application is made?",
		"answer": "A. The new fees have no effect on previously filed requests. You need to pay only one fee for your Form I-485. For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues.

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

	{
		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What proof is needed to show the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Such redaction is permissible when the evidence is only to support eligibility for a reduced fee and the redacted information is not otherwise relevant to the adjudication."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. How will small farmers who do not file IRS Forms 941 or 943 demonstrate that they are eligible for the half-price Asylum Program Fee for petitioners who are small employers?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"answer": "A. The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

	{
		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055.

		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",

In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

If you do not submit the correct fee, we must reject your form, even if you have submitted an overpayment. Please see our Filing Fees page for more details.\nIf you are submitting one of the following forms, the required fees depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer.\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker:\nPart 1, Question 6 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 7 of the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 15 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 6 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 14 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 15, and you answer Question 14 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker:\nPart 1, Question 8 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 3 of the Form I-129CW Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 14 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 8 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 13 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 14, and you answer Question 13 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers:\nPart 1, Question 5 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer.

		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date.

We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper.

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

Are these payments considered when the fees were changed, or do I have to repay these fees when a final decision on my application is made?",
		"answer": "A. The new fees have no effect on previously filed requests. You need to pay only one fee for your Form I-485. For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category.

Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

	{
		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",
		"answer": "A. No. You do not need to file Form I-912 with applications that are fee-exempt."

	{
		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

		"answer": "A. No. As discussed further below, Form I-485 is fee exempt for applicants seeking to adjust status as VAWA self-petitioners and for those applying under INA 245(l) (T nonimmigrants) or INA 245(m) (U nonimmigrants)."

If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."
	},

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",
		"answer": "A. No. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process multi-form submissions. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ.

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.

		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

		"answer": "A. An organization may still qualify if it is a governmental research organization or an educational institution as described above. Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

		"answer": "A. A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",

		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",

		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect O nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

		"answer": "A. Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

Just as adjudicators previously had access to Form I-942, they will have access to the reduced fee request in Part 10 of the new Form N-400."

		"question": "Q. Will there be a fee exemption for biometrics based on age?",
		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."

	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS determines that I am not eligible for a reduced Form N-400 fee, can I submit the difference in filing fee to prevent the application from being rejected?",

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

		"answer": "A. The correct fee and form version is based on the postmark date of the filing, not the date that we receive it. Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055.

		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

		"question": "Q. What happens to online filers after April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

We will no longer publish the guidelines in Form I-912P or Form I-942P.

If you file a Form I-765 for the (c)(9) category via the PDF filing option, you must pay a fee or submit a request for a fee waiver."

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues.

Such petitioners will pay $300 rather than the full $600 for the Asylum Program Fee.\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off.

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee.

For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category. However, refugees and people paroled as refugees may file a fee-exempt Form I-485 regardless of the underlying basis of adjustment."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"answer": "A. In general, yes. However, certain forms will not receive the online filing discount when they become available for online filing, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount. Such future online forms include:"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."

		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",
		"answer": "A. No. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process multi-form submissions. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms."

	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor.

		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category.

The rule changes the validity period for approval of a Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition, from 18 months to 15 months for Form I-600A applications filed on or after April 1, 2024.\nAnother key change is that we created a form supplement (Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3) that prospective adoptive parents can use for requests for action on approved suitability determinations in orphan cases (instead of prospective adoptive parents having to draft their own letter).\nThis version of Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3, is the only form that you should use to notify us about significant changes, extension requests, change of country requests, and the like. Do not use any previous versions of this form or other previous notification methods.\nThese changes will help align our processes for adoptions from countries that are not party to the Hague Adoption Convention (orphan cases) with the processes for adoptions from countries that are party to that Convention.\nAlso, the final rule provides fee exemptions for second extensions, second changes in country, duplicate approval notices, and Certificates of Citizenship and Naturalization for qualifying adoptees."

		"question": "Q. Why did USCIS change the validity period for Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition, and What is the new validity period for each?",
		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice. The validity period for approvals is 15 months from the approval date."

The Genealogy Program cannot provide certified copies or an original copy. We made agreements with the Italian Consulate and German Consulate that the applicant must present the packet provided by our office containing a photocopy of the naturalization certificate, the USCIS Genealogy Program response letter that is stapled to the records, and the envelope they arrived in to the Consulate in the United States.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. Where can I find the 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines?",
		"answer": "A. The 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines are available online, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services updates them annually. We will no longer publish the guidelines in Form I-912P or Form I-942P. However, we have created a new webpage containing Poverty Guidelines information, including  household income relevant for fee waivers and fee reductions based on a filer’s location, household size, and current U.S. Department of Health and Human Service guidelines."

		"question": "Q. Is there a way to request a fee waiver while filing online?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. For certain eligible Form I-765 categories available to file online using the PDF filing option, you may upload your completed Form I-912, Fee Waiver Request, with the completed Form I-765 you are requesting a fee waiver for, using your USCIS online account. See the Form I-912 page for additional details.\nAlternatively, you may still mail a paper version of Form I-912 with the form you are requesting a fee waiver for, if the underlying form is eligible for a fee waiver or reduction."

		"answer": "A.  If you are applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted, you should not submit your application through the PDF filing option at this time. If you file a Form I-765 for the (c)(9) category via the PDF filing option, you must pay a fee or submit a request for a fee waiver."

		"question": "Q. If a fee waiver is requested using an older version of Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, will USCIS still adjudicate the request and, if so, under which fee waiver rules? For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",

		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

	{
		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

		"question": "Q. The instructions for Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, imply that Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, would not be fee exempt for those adjusting status under VAWA or as a T or U nonimmigrant. Is that correct?",
		"answer": "A. No. As discussed further below, Form I-485 is fee exempt for applicants seeking to adjust status as VAWA self-petitioners and for those applying under INA 245(l) (T nonimmigrants) or INA 245(m) (U nonimmigrants)."

For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",
		"answer": "A. If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

		"answer": "A. See Forms Available to File Online for a complete list."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"question": "Q. As additional forms become available for online filing, will they also receive the online filing discount?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

	{
		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",
		"answer": "A. No. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process multi-form submissions. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing.

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"answer": "A. The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

The fee rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners, who are not required to pay the Asylum Program Fee.\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofit employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. For the precise discounted fees, please see the full fee schedule, Form G-1055.\nOn Form I-140, select Yes in Part 1, Question 5, if you are a nonprofit organization.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization (or Part 5, Question 8 on Form I-129CW)."

		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",

		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",

		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Please clarify whether the Form I-129 petition fee includes the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) and Fraud Prevention Fees. If not, have these fees changed?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect O nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."

For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."

	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

		"answer": "A. Please see the fee schedule table below to view a full list of the revised forms that go into effect when the new fees take effect on April 1, 2024. We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

		"question": "Q. If forms are postmarked by March 31, 2024, will the current (pre-April 1) USCIS fees apply, even if USCIS does not receive the forms before April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. The correct fee and form version is based on the postmark date of the filing, not the date that we receive it. Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055. We encourage you to use the online filing option when it is available."

		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

A new edition of the USCIS Pre-Order Instructions is on our Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page."

		"question": "Q. What happens to online filers after April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

You can see a comprehensive list of fees by viewing, Fee Schedule, Form G-1055.\nIn addition, our online fee calculator is available to determine the current fee for any form processed at a USCIS lockbox facility (which is the great majority of our forms)."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. Where can I find the 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines?",
		"answer": "A. The 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines are available online, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services updates them annually. We will no longer publish the guidelines in Form I-912P or Form I-942P. However, we have created a new webpage containing Poverty Guidelines information, including  household income relevant for fee waivers and fee reductions based on a filer’s location, household size, and current U.S. Department of Health and Human Service guidelines."

For certain eligible Form I-765 categories available to file online using the PDF filing option, you may upload your completed Form I-912, Fee Waiver Request, with the completed Form I-765 you are requesting a fee waiver for, using your USCIS online account. See the Form I-912 page for additional details.\nAlternatively, you may still mail a paper version of Form I-912 with the form you are requesting a fee waiver for, if the underlying form is eligible for a fee waiver or reduction."

		"question": "Q. I am applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted. Should I submit my application through the PDF filing option?",
		"answer": "A.  If you are applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted, you should not submit your application through the PDF filing option at this time. If you file a Form I-765 for the (c)(9) category via the PDF filing option, you must pay a fee or submit a request for a fee waiver."

		"question": "Q. If a fee waiver is requested using an older version of Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, will USCIS still adjudicate the request and, if so, under which fee waiver rules? For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS rejects a fee waiver request, and the application is resubmitted with the fee payment, will the receipt date be the date of the fee waiver submission or the date of the fee payment?",
		"answer": "A. We will not backdate the receipt date. The received date will be the received date for the application submitted with the required fee payment."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

	{
		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",

		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",

		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card.

It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing.

The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",

		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor.

		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee.

Are these payments considered when the fees were changed, or do I have to repay these fees when a final decision on my application is made?",
		"answer": "A. The new fees have no effect on previously filed requests. You need to pay only one fee for your Form I-485. For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions. Each application or motion has its own associated fee, and paying a fee for an initial application or motion does not discount fees for new applications or motions filed with DHS or EOIR after a final decision."

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category.

The Genealogy Program cannot provide certified copies or an original copy. We made agreements with the Italian Consulate and German Consulate that the applicant must present the packet provided by our office containing a photocopy of the naturalization certificate, the USCIS Genealogy Program response letter that is stapled to the records, and the envelope they arrived in to the Consulate in the United States.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."

	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"answer": "A. Nonprofit petitioners (including institutions of higher education) qualify for a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and do not need to pay the Asylum Program fee for those forms or Form I-140. For further discussion, see “Employment-Based Forms and Fees” below."

	{
		"question": "Q. Which forms are available for online filing?",
		"answer": "A. See Forms Available to File Online for a complete list."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. As additional forms become available for online filing, will they also receive the online filing discount?",
		"answer": "A. In general, yes. However, certain forms will not receive the online filing discount when they become available for online filing, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount. Such future online forms include:"
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",
		"answer": "A. No. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process multi-form submissions. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can attorneys or accredited representatives who file forms through their online account pay the associated fees online?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Once the form is signed, you can submit the form and the fee payment using an organizational account as a legal representative. See the “Demonstration of Organizational Accounts for Legal Representatives” video on our YouTube channel or our Organizational Accounts FAQ for more information."

If you do not submit the correct fee, we must reject your form, even if you have submitted an overpayment. Please see our Filing Fees page for more details.\nIf you are submitting one of the following forms, the required fees depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer.\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker:\nPart 1, Question 6 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 7 of the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 15 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 6 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 14 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 15, and you answer Question 14 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker:\nPart 1, Question 8 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 3 of the Form I-129CW Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 14 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 8 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 13 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 14, and you answer Question 13 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer.

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How do I pay the Asylum Program Fee? Is there a separate form or paperwork?",
		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Do I need to pay the Asylum Program Fee for each Form I-129 for the same employee (extensions, amendments, etc.)?",
		"answer": "A. In general, yes, you must pay the Asylum Program Fee for each Form I-129 filed, including for initial grants, extensions, and changes of employer. As discussed further below, small employers pay a reduced Asylum Program Fee, and nonprofits do not pay the fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q: May a beneficiary pay the Asylum Program Fee, or must it be the petitioner who pays?",
		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"answer": "A. An individual self-petitioner would pay the reduced Asylum Program Fee of $300 when filing Form I-140 as an EB-1A alien of extraordinary ability or as an EB-2 with national interest waiver. On Form I-140, such self-petitioners must select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, to indicate that they currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.\nWhen an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 or Form 1-140 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Asylum Program Fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity or individual.\nOn Form I-140, select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time employees.  Select Yes in Part 1, Question 5, if you are a nonprofit organization.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time employees.  Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

		"question": "Q. What are the fee discounts for small employers?",
		"answer": "A. The fee rule defines small employer petitioners as those with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Such petitioners will pay $300 rather than the full $600 for the Asylum Program Fee.\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off.

		"question": "Q. How will companies with fewer than 25 employees apply for a fee reduction of the Asylum Program Fee? Will there be a form like Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",
		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."
	},

		"question": "Q. What proof is needed to show the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. How will small farmers who do not file IRS Forms 941 or 943 demonstrate that they are eligible for the half-price Asylum Program Fee for petitioners who are small employers?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"answer": "A. The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.

	{
		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."
	},

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

The rule changes the validity period for approval of a Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition, from 18 months to 15 months for Form I-600A applications filed on or after April 1, 2024.\nAnother key change is that we created a form supplement (Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3) that prospective adoptive parents can use for requests for action on approved suitability determinations in orphan cases (instead of prospective adoptive parents having to draft their own letter).\nThis version of Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3, is the only form that you should use to notify us about significant changes, extension requests, change of country requests, and the like. Do not use any previous versions of this form or other previous notification methods.\nThese changes will help align our processes for adoptions from countries that are not party to the Hague Adoption Convention (orphan cases) with the processes for adoptions from countries that are party to that Convention.\nAlso, the final rule provides fee exemptions for second extensions, second changes in country, duplicate approval notices, and Certificates of Citizenship and Naturalization for qualifying adoptees."

		"question": "Q. Why did USCIS change the validity period for Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition, and What is the new validity period for each?",
		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice. The validity period for approvals is 15 months from the approval date."

The Genealogy Program cannot provide certified copies or an original copy. We made agreements with the Italian Consulate and German Consulate that the applicant must present the packet provided by our office containing a photocopy of the naturalization certificate, the USCIS Genealogy Program response letter that is stapled to the records, and the envelope they arrived in to the Consulate in the United States.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

	{
		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

We will no longer publish the guidelines in Form I-912P or Form I-942P. However, we have created a new webpage containing Poverty Guidelines information, including  household income relevant for fee waivers and fee reductions based on a filer’s location, household size, and current U.S. Department of Health and Human Service guidelines."

For certain eligible Form I-765 categories available to file online using the PDF filing option, you may upload your completed Form I-912, Fee Waiver Request, with the completed Form I-765 you are requesting a fee waiver for, using your USCIS online account. See the Form I-912 page for additional details.\nAlternatively, you may still mail a paper version of Form I-912 with the form you are requesting a fee waiver for, if the underlying form is eligible for a fee waiver or reduction."

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. No. As discussed further below, Form I-485 is fee exempt for applicants seeking to adjust status as VAWA self-petitioners and for those applying under INA 245(l) (T nonimmigrants) or INA 245(m) (U nonimmigrants)."

For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",

If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."

		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},

		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms.

If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual.

		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",

		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",

		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Are all supporting documents (such as cover letter, itinerary, evidence for the classification) that is based on the group, not individual members, filed alongside each Form I-129, or is one Form I-129 designated the primary petition?",

		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages.

For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

		"answer": "A. Please see the fee schedule table below to view a full list of the revised forms that go into effect when the new fees take effect on April 1, 2024. We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

		"answer": "A. The correct fee and form version is based on the postmark date of the filing, not the date that we receive it. Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055. We encourage you to use the online filing option when it is available."

		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

A new edition of the USCIS Pre-Order Instructions is on our Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page."

		"question": "Q. What happens to online filers after April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

	{
		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. Where can I find the 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines?",
		"answer": "A. The 2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines are available online, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services updates them annually. We will no longer publish the guidelines in Form I-912P or Form I-942P. However, we have created a new webpage containing Poverty Guidelines information, including  household income relevant for fee waivers and fee reductions based on a filer’s location, household size, and current U.S. Department of Health and Human Service guidelines."

	{
		"question": "Q. I am applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted. Should I submit my application through the PDF filing option?",
		"answer": "A.  If you are applying for a (c)(9) Pending Adjustment of Status category of Form I-765 that is fee exempted, you should not submit your application through the PDF filing option at this time. If you file a Form I-765 for the (c)(9) category via the PDF filing option, you must pay a fee or submit a request for a fee waiver."

		"question": "Q. If a fee waiver is requested using an older version of Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, will USCIS still adjudicate the request and, if so, under which fee waiver rules? For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS rejects a fee waiver request, and the application is resubmitted with the fee payment, will the receipt date be the date of the fee waiver submission or the date of the fee payment?",
		"answer": "A. We will not backdate the receipt date. The received date will be the received date for the application submitted with the required fee payment."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

	{
		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",

		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor.

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee.

Generally, if you already paid for Form I-485 before April 1, 2024, then you may continue to renew your Employment Authorization Document using Form I-765 for free while your adjustment of status remains pending.\nIf you file Form I-765 concurrently with Form I-485 on or after April 1, 2024, the Form I-765 will have a fee of $260.

Are these payments considered when the fees were changed, or do I have to repay these fees when a final decision on my application is made?",
		"answer": "A. The new fees have no effect on previously filed requests. You need to pay only one fee for your Form I-485. For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions. Each application or motion has its own associated fee, and paying a fee for an initial application or motion does not discount fees for new applications or motions filed with DHS or EOIR after a final decision."

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category.

The Genealogy Program cannot provide certified copies or an original copy. We made agreements with the Italian Consulate and German Consulate that the applicant must present the packet provided by our office containing a photocopy of the naturalization certificate, the USCIS Genealogy Program response letter that is stapled to the records, and the envelope they arrived in to the Consulate in the United States.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees.

If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

		"answer": "A. See Forms Available to File Online for a complete list."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing.

		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ.

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper.

		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well.

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."

	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule.

We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055.

If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",

We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",

	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor.

We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants.

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."

	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."

		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",
		"answer": "A. If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},

		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ.

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",

		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",

	{
		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

		"answer": "A. Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

		"question": "Q. Will there be a fee exemption for biometrics based on age?",
		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."

		"question": "Q. If USCIS determines that I am not eligible for a reduced Form N-400 fee, can I submit the difference in filing fee to prevent the application from being rejected?",

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

Are these payments considered when the fees were changed, or do I have to repay these fees when a final decision on my application is made?",
		"answer": "A. The new fees have no effect on previously filed requests. You need to pay only one fee for your Form I-485. For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

	{
		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. When was the last time USCIS increased fees?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055. We encourage you to use the online filing option when it is available."

		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024.

		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

If you do not submit the correct fee, we must reject your form, even if you have submitted an overpayment. Please see our Filing Fees page for more details.\nIf you are submitting one of the following forms, the required fees depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer.\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker:\nPart 1, Question 6 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 7 of the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 15 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 6 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 14 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 15, and you answer Question 14 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker:\nPart 1, Question 8 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 3 of the Form I-129CW Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 14 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 8 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 13 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 14, and you answer Question 13 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers:\nPart 1, Question 5 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer.

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork. If you file by mail and pay by check or money order, you should submit the Asylum Program Fee separately. If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor.

We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee.

		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

The Genealogy Program cannot provide certified copies or an original copy. We made agreements with the Italian Consulate and German Consulate that the applicant must present the packet provided by our office containing a photocopy of the naturalization certificate, the USCIS Genealogy Program response letter that is stapled to the records, and the envelope they arrived in to the Consulate in the United States.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",
		"answer": "A. If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

	{
		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",
		"answer": "A. No. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process multi-form submissions. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. Payment of the Asylum Program Fee does not require a separate form or paperwork.

If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing.

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ.

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Must a petitioner submit evidence of nonprofit status with each Form I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-140?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, the petitioner must demonstrate eligibility for fee reductions and exemptions in every submission, as with the substantive requirements for the underlying benefit."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How can I determine what fees to pay and what discounts are available when filing Form I-129 or Form I-140?",
		"answer": "A. A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",
		"answer": "A. The limit on named beneficiaries for Form I-129 applies regardless of the type of petitioner."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",
		"answer": "A. You may submit multiple petitions in one mailing if you file them on paper."

	{
		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Are all supporting documents (such as cover letter, itinerary, evidence for the classification) that is based on the group, not individual members, filed alongside each Form I-129, or is one Form I-129 designated the primary petition?",

		"question": "Q. Please clarify whether the Form I-129 petition fee includes the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) and Fraud Prevention Fees. If not, have these fees changed?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

	{
		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect O nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect P nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For P nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,015. However, the fee only increases to $510 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

		"question": "Q. If an applicant uses Form I-942 during the grace period, will USCIS still apply the new income limits when adjudicating a request for a reduced N-400 fee?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

Just as adjudicators previously had access to Form I-942, they will have access to the reduced fee request in Part 10 of the new Form N-400."

		"question": "Q. Will there be a fee exemption for biometrics based on age?",
		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS determines that I am not eligible for a reduced Form N-400 fee, can I submit the difference in filing fee to prevent the application from being rejected?",

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

		"answer": "A. The new validity period for both orphan and Hague approval notices is now 15 months from the date of approval. You will see this on your approval notice. We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

	{
		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What proof is needed to show the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Such redaction is permissible when the evidence is only to support eligibility for a reduced fee and the redacted information is not otherwise relevant to the adjudication."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

		"question": "Q. For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. How will small farmers who do not file IRS Forms 941 or 943 demonstrate that they are eligible for the half-price Asylum Program Fee for petitioners who are small employers?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"question": "Q. When a petitioner is an agent or sponsoring organization, not the beneficiary’s employer, can they be eligible for a reduced Form I-129 fee and reduced Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Do beneficiary-owners pay the discounted fee for Form I-129?",
		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

The fee rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners, who are not required to pay the Asylum Program Fee.\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofit employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. For the precise discounted fees, please see the full fee schedule, Form G-1055.\nOn Form I-140, select Yes in Part 1, Question 5, if you are a nonprofit organization.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization (or Part 5, Question 8 on Form I-129CW)."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. When was the last time USCIS increased fees?",
		"answer": "A. We published our previous fee schedule in a fee rule  (PDF) that went into effect more than 7 years ago, on Dec. 23, 2016."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

We will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024, through June 3, 2024. During this grace period, we will accept previous and new editions of certain forms, filed with the correct fee.\nThere will be no grace period for the following new forms, however, because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition prior to the April 1, 2024, effective date:\nWe will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the received date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.\nThe fee rule edition of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, will incorporate a request for a reduced fee, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee. If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942. If you apply during the grace period and use the prior edition of Form N-400 and you wish to request a reduced fee, you will need submit Form I-942."

		"question": "Q. If forms are postmarked by March 31, 2024, will the current (pre-April 1) USCIS fees apply, even if USCIS does not receive the forms before April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. The correct fee and form version is based on the postmark date of the filing, not the date that we receive it. Forms with a postmark date of March 31, 2024, or earlier must be submitted with the current (pre-April 1) fees. Forms with a postmark date of April 1, 2024, or later must be submitted with the fee implemented by the new fee rule and listed on the Fee Schedule, Form G-1055. We encourage you to use the online filing option when it is available."

		"question": "Q. Can you explain how your lockbox staff use the postmark for commercial couriers such as FedEx and UPS?",
		"answer": "A. Our lockbox facilities accept courier deliveries from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. For commercial couriers, the postmark date is the date on the shipping label. If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

A new edition of the USCIS Pre-Order Instructions is on our Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page."

		"question": "Q. What happens to online filers after April 1, 2024?",
		"answer": "A. If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues.

There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

Please see our Filing Fees page for more details.\nIf you are submitting one of the following forms, the required fees depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer.\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker:\nPart 1, Question 6 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer. To determine whether you qualify as a nonprofit, please refer to page 7 of the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPart 5, Question 15 asks “Do you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees in the United States including all affiliates or subsidiaries of this company/organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a small employer (unless you checked “Yes” in Part 1, Question 6 for nonprofits, as described above).\nIn addition, Part 5, Question 14 asks for your “Current Number of Employees in the United States.” If you check “Yes” to Part 5, Question 15, and you answer Question 14 with a number greater than 25, then your supporting documentation should demonstrate how you calculated the number of full-time equivalent employees as 25 or fewer. If we cannot determine the number of full-time equivalent employees, we may reject your petition.\nForm I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker:\nPart 1, Question 8 asks “Are you a nonprofit organized as tax exempt or a governmental research organization?” If you answer “Yes,” then you must submit the proper payment for a nonprofit, and not for a small employer.

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

		"answer": "A. The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants.

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled. This means that if you file Form I-485 on or after April 1, 2024, you will have to pay separate fees for Forms I-131 and I-765.\nThe new fee for Form I-131 when seeking advance parole is $630.\nThe new fee for Form I-765 is $470 (online filing) or $520 (paper filing).

For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. The U nonimmigrant would only qualify for the fee exemption if they applied to adjust status under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or another fee-exempt category.

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule state that USCIS may require that certain fees be paid using a certain payment method or that certain fees cannot be paid using a particular method?",
		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. The fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers the operational costs of adjudicating USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits in a timely way. We need higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If you are requesting a reduced fee using the new edition of the form, do not submit Form I-942.

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

	{
		"question": "Q. How does the fee rule expand fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

	{
		"question": "Q. Are there any special forms or eligibility requirements to file for fee exemptions?",
		"answer": "A. No. Fee exemptions do not require a separate form or eligibility criteria, although we may require evidence for the fee exemption. We identify a fee exemption by the category or basis of filing identified in the form. Do not submit a fee when the form is fee exempt."

	{
		"question": "Q. For humanitarian applications that are fee-exempt, do we need to file Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver?",

	{
		"question": "Q. If someone includes a fee for something that should be fee-exempt, will the fee be returned?",
		"answer": "A. Do not submit a fee when filing for a fee-exempt category. We may intake the fee and not return the fee if you submit a fee with a fee-exempt form."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How much did USCIS have to increase other fees to provide the new fee exemptions in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. In the final rule, we forecasted that, as a general matter, the revenue represented by the new fee exemptions is about 3% of the total forecasted revenue. Fee-exempt services have no effect on those fees that are capped at a certain amount in the final rule."

		"question": "Q. Is there a fee exemption for Form I-102,Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, for VAWA petitioners, T nonimmigrants, or other protection-based filers?",
		"answer": "A. No, the fee exemptions for Form I-102 only apply to certain military-related applicants and those seeking a replacement due to DHS error. However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status. They may also visit the Customs and Border Patrol website to obtain a paper version of an electronic Form I-94."

		"answer": "A. No. As discussed further below, Form I-485 is fee exempt for applicants seeking to adjust status as VAWA self-petitioners and for those applying under INA 245(l) (T nonimmigrants) or INA 245(m) (U nonimmigrants)."

For example, if a U-1 nonimmigrant petitioner files Form I-131 on behalf of a family member, does the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) apply?",
		"answer": "A. If you file Form I-131 for someone else, the fee exemptions at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) and 106.3(b) apply only if the person you are filing for belongs to one of the fee-exempt categories listed.\nFor example, if you hold or are seeking U-1 nonimmigrant status and you file Form I-131 for a family member, the fee exemption at 8 CFR 106.3(b)(5)(i) would only apply if you also filed Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, or Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, for the derivative family member, or if the family member otherwise possesses or seeks U nonimmigrant status or seeks adjustment of status under INA 245(m).\nTo request a fee exemption for Form I-131 in this situation, please include a copy of the receipt notice or other evidence you filed the relevant form (for example, Form I-918A or Form I-929) for the derivative family member for whom you are also filing Form I-131, or other evidence that the family member falls into one of the categories listed at 8 CFR 106.2(a)(7) or 106.3(b).\nOtherwise, if you are filing Form I-131 for someone else, you may be eligible to request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver.\nIf we have denied Form I-131 that you filed for another person, and you file Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, appealing or asking us to reopen or reconsider the decision, Form I-290B is fee-exempt if the underlying Form I-131 was fee-exempt as outlined above."

	{
		"question": "Q. Why is there a $50 discount for filing forms online instead of filing them by mail?",
		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

		"question": "Q. Which forms currently available to file online will not get an online discount?",
		"answer": "A. Although the $50 discount applies to most forms filed online with USCIS, there are limited circumstances where it does not apply, such as when the form fee is already provided at a substantial discount, or the law prohibits USCIS from charging a full cost recovery level fee.\nSuch online forms that will not receive the online filing discount include:"

		"question": "Q. Does the online filing discount apply to other fees besides form fees?",
		"answer": "A. No. The online filing discount applies only to fees for forms. It does not apply to additional fees associated with certain benefit requests, such as the Asylum Program Fee, American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fees, fraud detection and prevention fees (for H-1B, H-2B, L, and CW-1 petitions), or premium processing fees."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can I file concurrently when one form is available to file online but the other form can only be filed on paper?",
		"answer": "A. For now, no. For example, if you wish to concurrently file Form I-130 (which is currently available for online filing) along with Form I-485 (which is currently only available for paper filing), then you must file both forms on paper. If you choose to file Form I-130 online, then , you must wait to receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) to obtain the $50 online filing discount You must then include the receipt notice when you file Form I-485."

		"question": "Q. If separate fees are required when I file multiple forms together, may I pay with one check?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In general, when filing one form that includes multiple fees (for example, Form I-129 for an H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B nonimmigrant), are multiple payments required?",
		"answer": "A. For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues. All payments within a submission must be the same type—check, money order, or credit card—because the Lockbox cannot process filings containing different payment types."

		"question": "Q. Can USCIS increase credit card limits when the new fees go into effect?",
		"answer": "A. There is a daily transaction limit of $24,999.99 per credit card, set by the Department of the Treasury.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 H-1B cap filing season, however, the Department of the Treasury has given USCIS an exemption to the $24,999.99 limit in order to provide a limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card. This waiver does not apply to other filings.\nWe can no longer accept credit card payments for Form I-956 and Form I-956F because the fee for these forms exceeds the daily transaction limit."

		"question": "Q. What is the Asylum Program Fee and who pays it?",
		"answer": "A. The Asylum Program Fee ($600) is a separate fee paid by employers who file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. It is not included in the changes in the filing fees for those individual forms, and it does not replace other fees such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee. The Asylum Program Fee helps fund the asylum program while mitigating the scope of fee increases for other benefit requests. The fee rule includes special discounts for nonprofits and small employers, as described further below.\nAll the work at USCIS is connected—when we have a more fully funded corps of asylum officers, our non-asylum officers can concentrate more exclusively on adjudicating cases from employers and other filers, bringing down processing times for everyone."

If you file online, or file by mail and pay by credit, debit, or prepaid card, you may submit one payment for all fees, including the Asylum Program fee."

The new fee rule does not change existing limitations on beneficiaries paying for certain petitioner-related expenses in the filing of a petition, including limitations under U.S. Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.\nFor examples, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(C), and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D).\nFor Department of Labor information, see 20 CFR 655.135(j) (H-2A), 20 CFR 655.20(o) (H-2B), and Department of Labor Fact Sheet #78D: Deductions and prohibited fees under the H-2B Program and Fact Sheet #26: Section H-2A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)."

Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing.

		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."

The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."

The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."

FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. What if the IRS has not officially approved an organization’s nonprofit status?",
		"answer": "A. An organization may still qualify if it is a governmental research organization or an educational institution as described above. Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

		"question": "Q. Must a petitioner submit evidence of nonprofit status with each Form I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-140?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How can I determine what fees to pay and what discounts are available when filing Form I-129 or Form I-140?",
		"answer": "A. A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Does the limit of 25 named beneficiaries per Form I-129 apply to the U.S. entity petitioner? What if it is a multinational petitioner?",
		"answer": "A. The limit on named beneficiaries for Form I-129 applies regardless of the type of petitioner."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. For a group petition that must be separated into multiple forms due to the 25 beneficiaries cap, how should these forms be submitted so that it is evident they are part of a whole?",
		"answer": "A. You may submit multiple petitions in one mailing if you file them on paper."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How will USCIS adjudicate P-1 filings where the beneficiaries are part of the same group but need to be split into separate filings because of the named beneficiaries limit? How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

		"question": "Q. Are all supporting documents (such as cover letter, itinerary, evidence for the classification) that is based on the group, not individual members, filed alongside each Form I-129, or is one Form I-129 designated the primary petition?",
		"answer": "A. When petitioning for more than 25 named beneficiaries, the employer must submit copies of all supporting documentation with each separate petition."

		"question": "Q. Please clarify whether the Form I-129 petition fee includes the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) and Fraud Prevention Fees. If not, have these fees changed?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Can employers apply for a fee waiver?",
		"answer": "A. In general, fee waivers are not available for Form I-129 or Form I-140. However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect O nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For O nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,055. However, the fee only increases to $530 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of O nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. What are the changes in the fee rule that affect P nonimmigrant visas?",
		"answer": "A. For P nonimmigrant beneficiaries, the fee for Form I-129 increases from $460 to $1,015. However, the fee only increases to $510 for petitioners who are nonprofits or small employers. Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, though there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits. The fee rule also limits the number of P nonimmigrant beneficiaries that can be included on one petition to 25."

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"question": "Q. What is the Form N-400 reduced fee amount?",
		"answer": "A. The reduced fee for Form N-400 will be $380 as of April 1, 2024.\nNote the new fee rule edition of Form N-400 incorporates in Part 10 a request for a reduced fee based on household income, eliminating the need to submit Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, which is being discontinued.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a reduced fee, select “Yes” in Part 10, Item Number 1, then complete Part 10, and submit $380 and documentation to support the reduced fee."

		"answer": "A. Yes. An applicant submitting a request for a fee waiver should submit Form N-400 along with Form I-912 (or a written request) and without a fee.\nYou cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver; you must file a paper Form N-400.\nIf you are applying for a fee waiver, you are not required to completed Part 10 of the Form N-400.

		"question": "Q. Can I file Form N-400 online and request a fee reduction in Part 10 of the N-400?",
		"answer": "A. No. You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400. Applicants requesting a reduced fee must submit Form N-400 with Part 10 completed on paper. The 04/01/24 edition of the form incorporates the reduced fee request in Part 10, and no separate Form I-942 is necessary."

		"question": "Q. If an applicant uses Form I-942 during the grace period, will USCIS still apply the new income limits when adjudicating a request for a reduced N-400 fee?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we will apply the new income limits (household income less than or equal to 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) to all reduced fee requests that are postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, even if the applicant uses Form I-942 with the old Form N-400 version during the grace period."

		"question": "Q. What documentation should N-400 applicants submit to establish household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines to obtain a reduced fee?",

According to the Form N-400 instructions, you may show your income or that of a household member by submitting the most recent federal tax return, consecutive pay statements for at least one month, a recent Form W-2, Form SSA-1099, or an employment statement showing salary or wages paid."

		"question": "Q. Will the lockbox facilities continue to adjudicate reduced fee requests?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. The lockbox facilities will continue to adjudicate any reduced fee request before the case is sent to a field office for the naturalization adjudication. Just as adjudicators previously had access to Form I-942, they will have access to the reduced fee request in Part 10 of the new Form N-400."

		"question": "Q. Will there be a fee exemption for biometrics based on age?",
		"answer": "A. No. We will no longer have a biometrics fee exemption for applicants over the age of 75. We updated our policy in 2017 to require biometrics regardless of age, because new electronic processing of applications and improved technology allow us to capture fingerprints for applicants of all ages. The cost of biometric services is now incorporated into Form N-400 fees, and there is no longer a biometric services fee."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. If USCIS determines that I am not eligible for a reduced Form N-400 fee, can I submit the difference in filing fee to prevent the application from being rejected?",

The fees for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, will no longer be bundled.

Are these payments considered when the fees were changed, or do I have to repay these fees when a final decision on my application is made?",
		"answer": "A. The new fees have no effect on previously filed requests. You need to pay only one fee for your Form I-485. For information about what to do after an immigration court grants relief or protection from removal, see Post-Order Instructions for Individuals Granted Relief or Protection from Removal by Immigration Court.\nFees submitted to DHS for EOIR applications, relief, or motions to reopen or reconsider apply only to those associated applications or motions.

Does an applicant who has protection-based status (for example, T and U nonimmigrant status) have to apply for adjustment of status based on that specific ground of eligibility to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status?",
		"answer": "A. In most cases yes, an applicant for adjustment of status must seek adjustment based on the fee-exempt classification to qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485. For example, if a U nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status as an immediate relative spouse of a U.S. citizen, they would not qualify for a fee exemption for Form I-485.

We may request new biometrics before approving the application so that we may keep the fingerprints current as well. We revised and republished revisions to the orphan and Hague regulations to eliminate the disparity between the 18-month approval period for the Form I–600A, the 15-month validity period of FBI fingerprint clearances, the 15-month approval period for a Form I–800A, and any approved extension. Please note extensions should be filed timely to avoid rejections.  Families may file to extend their suitability approval up to 90 days before it expires. Note: There may be some instances where the biometric validity period and the 15-month Form I-600A and Form I-800A validity period do not perfectly align due to operational limitations and may differ by a few days on the approval notice.

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule.

		"question": "Q. Why does USCIS need a new fee schedule?",

		"question": "Q. What about funding from Congress?",
		"answer": "A. We receive 96% of our funding from filing fees, not from congressional appropriations.\nFortunately, Congress provided much-needed support in fiscal year 2022, appropriating $275 million specifically to reduce current backlogs and advance our humanitarian mission. Congress also supported our refugee and asylum activities with appropriations of $133 million in FY 2023 and $145 million in FY 2024.\nWe will require continued congressional support to eliminate our current backlogs. We intend for the new fee rule to allow us to keep pace with incoming cases and prevent backlogs from growing.\nWe also continue to require congressional funding to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of cases associated with recent border crossers. This includes the need to hire additional USCIS personnel to better manage the number of cases we now receive."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. How did current backlogs accumulate in the first place?",
		"answer": "A. As described in our Fiscal Year 2022 Progress Report, immigration filings decreased dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue temporarily dropped by 40%. A hiring freeze and workforce attrition reduced the agency’s capacity to complete cases, even as incoming caseloads rebounded to pre-COVID levels.\nWe lifted our hiring freeze in March 2021, and we are working to fill current vacancies by recruiting and training new staff—we are hiring!\nWe have continued to deliver improved services even in advance of the new fee rule. To stay on a strong fiscal footing and continue improving our delivery of timely decisions, we need the resources that this fee rule will provide."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q.  How will the new fee schedule affect USCIS backlogs and processing times?",
		"answer": "A. We recognize that when there are backlogs, people experience longer wait times to receive decisions. We understand the impact of such delays on those we serve, and emphasize that our core mission is to ensure the timely processing of immigration requests.\nFiscal year 2023 was the first year that we successfully reduced our backlog in more than a decade—a reduction of 15%. This progress occurred even as we experienced a record year in filings received—10.9 million during FY 2023, compared with a more typical level of 9 million receipts in FY 2022 and FY 2021. The backlog grew by 16% in FY 2022, which was slower growth than the two previous years—43% in FY 2021 and 26% in FY 2020.\nThe slower backlog growth rate in FY 2022 and decline in FY 2023 were driven by ongoing efforts to increase hiring and develop new efficiencies in case processing. Congress also supported this effort with $275 million in appropriated funding in FY 2022.\nThe new fee schedule will allow USCIS to more fully recover our operating costs, reestablish and maintain timely case processing, support the development and implementation of tools that further increase our efficiency and improve the customer experience, and help prevent the accumulation of future case backlogs.\nFor more information, please see our FY 2023 progress report and historical median processing times."

		"question": "Q. How much revenue does USCIS expect to receive under the new fee schedule?",
		"answer": "A. We expected the previous fee schedule, in place since 2016, to yield an average of $3.28 billion per year (excluding fees for premium processing and temporary programs). Under the fee schedule proposed in January 2023, we would have received an estimated average of $5.2 billion per year.\nUnder this final rule, we expect to receive an average of $4.42 billion per year. This is 14.1% less revenue—and less cost burden on those filing requests—than the proposed rule. This final rule removed $727 million of average annual estimated costs by transferring costs to premium processing revenue, reducing the work to be funded by the Asylum Program Fee, and considering the budget effects of improved efficiency measures.\nThe final fee rule is expected to generate an additional average $1.14 billion per year in agency revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. This is the amount necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not grow in the future."

		"question": "Q.  Why does USCIS need a “carryover” balance of cash reserves?",
		"answer": "A. The Government Accountability Office acknowledges that fee-funded agencies may need to designate funds as operating reserves to weather periods when revenue collections are lower than costs. For federal entities such as USCIS that rely almost entirely on fee revenue, it is critical that they maintain a sufficient “carryover” balance of cash reserves, helping ensure that adequate funds are available to meet daily obligation and outlay requirements. Historically, for example, our fee revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year is low due to seasonal filing patterns and expenses are higher due to contract year startups. Therefore, carryover funds are necessary to pay federal salaries, maintain expenses, and award certain contracts during periods of cash flow deficits. DHS FMPM Section 2.12, Fee Review and Guidance, requires USCIS to have a carryover balance at the end of each fiscal year to meet the forecast expenses for the first three months of the fiscal year.\nFor more on the importance of maintaining a healthy carryover balance, please our FY 2022 Progress Report, in particular Section IV, “From Fiscal Crisis to Fiscal Responsibility.”"

If there is no shipping date on the label, we consider the date you printed the label to be the postmark date. If the label does not have a shipping date or a print date, we will consider the postmark date to be 10 days before we received the package at the lockbox."

For all other forms, we will publish the 04/01/24 version on April 1, 2024, and we will allow prior editions during a grace period from April 1 to June 3, 2024. For Forms I-129, I-129CW, I-140, and I-600/I-600A/Supplements, there will be no grace period because we are changing the forms for fee calculation."

If you have already submitted a benefit request either online or in paper form, the fee rule does not affect that pending request and you need to take no further action.\nWe provided new versions of forms on April 1, 2024, and so now you cannot submit older versions of forms.\nOn April 1, 2024, we deleted any drafts of Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, in progress, and you will have to restart the Form N-400 application. We had to do this because Form N-400 is the only form currently available for online filing for which the online version did not have a grace period when the new form version was required starting April 1. We notified users in their myUSCIS accounts that such drafts would be deleted and they would need to start a new application on April 1.\nFor all other forms, however, we updated drafts in progress on April 1 with the new version of the respective form."

		"question": "Q. How did DHS calculate the various fee increases in the final rule?",
		"answer": "A. DHS is authorized under statute to recover the full costs of providing USCIS services, including the costs of services provided without charge to asylum applicants and other aliens. In other words, we are permitted to collect fees that may cover our total operational costs.\nThis means that the fees for a particular form may include the unit cost of adjudicating that form, plus an additional amount to cover the agency’s non-adjudication overhead expenses. As part of that overhead, filers who pay the full fee may cover our costs to adjudicate fee-exempt, fee-reduced, and fee-waived cases.\nIn addition, the fee rule includes a new Asylum Program Fee of $600 that employers pay if they file either Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; or Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers. The fee covers some of the costs associated with asylum processing, which does not include its own fee. This fee increase for employer petitioners mitigates the size of the fee increases for many individual filers.\nIn response to public comments, the final rule provides special relief for nonprofit petitioners (who will not pay the Asylum Program Fee) and for small employer petitioners with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (these petitioners will pay half-price, or a $300 Asylum Program Fee).\nIn addition, for the fees for Form I-129 and Form I-129CW, nonprofits and small employers will pay a discounted fee of up to 50% off. We continue to emphasize that Congress could reduce the burden on our fee-paying customers by fully funding our humanitarian mission, as it does for other agencies."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase the H-1B registration fee?",
		"answer": "A. In 2019, a different rule  (PDF) established a $10 registration fee per beneficiary for H-1B registrations. The $10 registration fee is separate from, and in addition to, the H-1B petition filing fee for Form I-129. We require the registration fee regardless of whether the prospective petitioner’s registration is selected. At that time, we did not have sufficient data to precisely estimate the costs of the registration process and implemented the $10 fee to provide an initial stream of revenue to fund part of the costs to USCIS for operating the registration program.\nThe $215 H-1B registration fee under the new fee rule is based on empirical cost estimates, as anticipated in the implementing regulation. See 88 FR 402, 500-501 (Jan. 4, 2023). Using results of the fiscal year 2022/2023 fee review, DHS based the fee on the activity costs for informing the public and management and oversight. DHS also recognizes the burden saved for H-1B filers through this registration system.\nPlease note that H-1B registration fee during the March 2024 H-1B registration period will remain $10, and the new $215 registration fee under the new fee rule will not be charged to prospective employers until the March 2025 registration period."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule increase EB-5 program fees?",
		"answer": "A. The final rule increases EB-5 program fees consistent with the fees for other benefit requests. As explained in the final rule, the fee amounts indicated by the full cost recovery model for the immigrant investor forms are not capped or decreased below the estimated full cost recovery as with some other forms, and DHS believes that the requirements for financial wherewithal in the program are inconsistent with shifting the costs of the EB-5 program to be funded by the fees paid for other requests.\nDHS has begun the fee study required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022  (PDF) to meet the additional fee guidelines and processing time requirements. The law requires DHS to set fees for EB-5 program-related immigration benefit requests at a level sufficient to recover the costs of providing such services and completing the adjudications within certain time frames.\nFor each relevant form, the following table (adapted from Table 1 of the final fee rule) compares the previously enacted fee, the fee from the January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024.\nOn or before this effective date, we will also post an updated comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage.\nCurrent vs. Final Fees"

For example, will USCIS still apply the new rules regarding means-tested benefits received by family members?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, we accept the current or older versions of Form I-912, but we apply the new fee waiver rules to all filings postmarked on or after April 1, 2024, regardless of whether the filing includes an older version of Form I-912 that reflects the former rules."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is the difference between a \"fee waiver” and a “fee exemption”?",
		"answer": "A. We grant a “fee waiver” for certain forms when the filer demonstrates their inability to pay based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, household income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or extreme financial hardship. When we create a “fee exemption” for particular forms or filers, the form is categorically free, and the filer does not need to demonstrate an inability to pay."

Before this final rule, we provided fee exemptions (authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) through policy guidance documents, such as form instructions, our policy manual, and similar directives, but not always in regulations. In this final rule, we codify several longstanding fee exemptions, including for humanitarian-related forms, because of the humanitarian nature of these programs and the likelihood that people who file requests related to these categories will qualify for a fee waiver if they request it.\nIn addition, the final rule provides new fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests, including:\nYou can find a complete list of previous and additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Tables 5A, 5B, and 5C, as well as in the section below under “Fee Exemptions and Fee Waivers Chart.”"

However, self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), people seeking T nonimmigrant status, and those filing under other humanitarian and protection-based categories may request a fee waiver for Form I-102, as with any other fees associated with their humanitarian or protection-based status.

		"answer": "A. We encourage online filing—when available—for a more efficient electronic submission and adjudication process. It requires significant operational resources to intake, store, and handle paper submissions. Also, information recorded on paper cannot be effectively standardized for data entry. Every request submitted online instead of on paper provides direct and immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies to both USCIS and filers—benefits that will increase throughout an individual’s immigration journey as more forms become available for online filing and case management."

For online filings, you must pay all the fees associated with one form submission simultaneously.\nFor filing by mail and paying by check or money order, we recommend submitting each related payment separately, because doing so provides more flexibility for addressing fee issues.

		"answer": "A. No additional form is needed. The new versions of Forms I-129, I-129CW, and I-140 contain fields where the petitioner can indicate if they employ 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and we will determine the proper fee based on the petitioner’s response and supporting documentation."

	{
		"question": "Q. What is a “full-time equivalent employee” in determining whether a petitioner qualifies for the small-employer discounts to the Form I-129 fee and Asylum Program Fee?",
		"answer": "A. Generally, the number of full-time equivalent employees equals the number of full-time employees plus the number of part-time employees aggregated to full-time equivalents at the time of filing. The IRS defines an employee as an individual who receives “wages,” with applicable taxes deducted, along with Social Security and unemployment deductions, and who receives a W-2 reporting their income."

	{
		"question": "Q. Should a petitioner count only those full-time equivalent employees listed under the petitioner’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)? What about employees listed under affiliated FEINs (for example, affiliated offices in different regions)?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioners should include all the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees in the United States, including its affiliates and subsidiaries. The petitioner should not, however, include additional employees from the petitioning employer’s parent company or the parents of any affiliates. In other words, in an organizational chart that begins with the petitioner, count down and horizontally, including the petitioning employer’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but do not count upward toward the petitioner’s parent or its affiliates’ parents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What proof is needed to show the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. The instructions for Forms I-129 and I-140 state that possible evidence includes a copy of the petitioner’s most recent IRS Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Return; or IRS Form 943, Employer’ Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Workers. However, petitioners may submit any relevant evidence that shows the number of full-time equivalent employees by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, the petitioner may include a list of the names of their full and part time employees and the average hours worked per week, with a calculation that converts the total hours worked by their employees into total FTEs."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because the IRS Form 941 includes salary information, can petitioners redact this information for privacy reasons?",
		"answer": "A. Yes. Such redaction is permissible when the evidence is only to support eligibility for a reduced fee and the redacted information is not otherwise relevant to the adjudication."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. What additional information or evidence should a petitioner submit if they employ fewer full-time equivalent employees than the number of employees listed on IRS Form 941 or 943?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers may submit any relevant evidence to show their actual number of full-time equivalent employees and must establish that number by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioning employer should explain why the actual number of full-time equivalent employees differs from the number on their Form 941 or Form 943."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Is a headcount of current employees sufficient for determining the number of full-time equivalent employees?",
		"answer": "A. Headcount is relevant in determining the number of full-time equivalent employees, but petitioners should be sure to aggregate part-time employees to full-time equivalents."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Because IRS Forms 941 and 943 provide a number of employees on payroll instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, how will USCIS account for this distinction?",
		"answer": "A. If the number of employees identified on the IRS Form 941 or Form 943 is more than 25, but the actual number of FTE employees is 25 or fewer, the petitioner should submit additional documentation that distinguishes the FTE employees from non-FTE employees."

For H-2A petitions filed by a U.S. agricultural producer association named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification, would each joint employer have to submit evidence of their number of full-time equivalent employees with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker? Or just the association?",
		"answer": "A.  Only the association would have to submit evidence of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. FTE employees for associations (or similar entities) include current FTE employees of the petitioner and the number of current FTE H-2A workers the association has previously petitioned for as the joint employer of its association member-farms. The employee count must also include everyone currently directly employed by affiliates and/or subsidiaries of the petitioner. However, the employee count does not include workers directly employed by member-farms if these workers are not the beneficiaries of a petition filed by the association or similar entity.\nAssociations who currently (directly or jointly) employ more than 25 FTE employees must state in Part 5, Question 14, of the Form I-129 either the exact number of such employees or a number higher than 25 (for example, “26”) and must pay the full fee amount. If a petitioner believes they qualify for a fee discount as a small employer, they must state the exact number of their FTE employees in Part 5, Question 14 of the Form I-129 and submit evidence of their own current FTE employees, including all employees of association members for whom they have previously petitioned and who are within their approved validity period at the time of filing."

		"question": "Q. How will small farmers who do not file IRS Forms 941 or 943 demonstrate that they are eligible for the half-price Asylum Program Fee for petitioners who are small employers?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Will petitioning employers that use a professional employer organization (PEO) still be subject to the full Asylum Program Fee even if the petitioning company has 25 or fewer employees?",
		"answer": "A. Petitioning employers who outsource certain functions through a PEO should not count the PEO’s full-time equivalent employees in determining whether the petitioner qualifies as a small employer. However, in the absence of a Form 941, the petitioner must submit alternate documentation to confirm how many full-time equivalent employees they currently employ. We do not require a specific form to confirm the petitioner’s full-time equivalent employees."

		"answer": "A. The fees for an agent petitioner (as in the O or P context, among others) or a sponsoring organization petitioner (as in the P context) follow the same rules as any other Form I-129 petitioning entity or individual. Both the Form I-129 fee and the Asylum Program Fee depend on the petitioner’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity."

		"answer": "A. When an individual beneficiary of a Form I-129 petition is a part or sole owner of the petitioning entity, then the Form I-129 fee depends on the petitioning entity’s number of employees and nonprofit status, as is the case for any petitioning entity.\nOn Form I-129, select Yes in Part 5, Question 15, if you currently employ a total of 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Select Yes in Part 1, Question 6, if you are a nonprofit organization."

		"question": "Q. Is an IRS determination letter recognizing an organization as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) sufficient evidence for a fee exemption?",
		"answer": "A. Yes, an organization’s Determination Letter from the IRS or copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate are acceptable evidence of nonprofit status for purposes of requesting a reduced fee for Forms I-129 and I-129CW, and an exemption from the Asylum Program Fee."

Otherwise, the petitioner does not qualify for the reduced Form I-129 fee or Asylum Program Fee exemption until the IRS has officially designated it as a 501(c)(3) organization."

	{
		"question": "Q. In determining that a petitioner qualifies as a nonprofit organization, will you need an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter? What about organizations without a formal IRS determination letter, such as a church?",
		"answer": "A. In general, petitioners may provide any relevant evidence to establish eligibility, including an organization’s determination letter from the IRS or a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. A religious organization filing a Form I-129 petition for an R-1 nonimmigrant religious worker must submit an IRS determination letter to establish that they are a bona fide nonprofit religious organization; thus, we generally expect the same IRS determination letter for a religious organization claiming a discounted fee as a nonprofit."

A table of the new fee schedule is posted on this page under the heading “New Fee Schedule Table.” We also post an updated, comprehensive fee schedule on our Fee Schedule webpage, which contains an additional feature that allows you to select the individual form and see all fees associated with it. We also have an online Fee Calculator that you can use to help determine your fee.\nThe fees for filing Form I-129 depend on the specific classification and whether there are named or unnamed beneficiaries."
	},
	{
		"question": "Q. Why are you limiting the number of named beneficiaries on a petition to 25?",
		"answer": "A. The cost to adjudicate a nonimmigrant petition increases with each additional named beneficiary. The fee structure providing the same fee regardless of the number of nonimmigrants included in the petition disproportionally shifts the costs of processing nonimmigrant petitions to those with few beneficiaries compared to those with large numbers of beneficiaries. In other words, petitioners filing petitions with low named beneficiary counts subsidize the cost of petitioners filing petitions with high named beneficiary counts. The limitation on the number of beneficiaries shifts the costs of adjudicating nonimmigrant petitions toward those petitions that require us to expend the most resources and reduces the relative fee burden on petitions with fewer beneficiaries."

How will USCIS match P-1S petitions with the principal P-1 petitions when filings are split? How will USCIS assess the 75 percent rule for the P-1B classification if filings need to be split?",
		"answer": "A. We suggest that petitioners make clear in a cover letter with each petition that they are submitting multiple, related filings for beneficiaries who are part of the same group and provide any related receipt numbers if they are not being filed at the same time. Petitioners should be similarly clear regarding their P-1S petitions in identifying the principal petition and providing the receipt number for the principal petition, when available. The 75% rule will apply to the entire group that is requested and not just the specific beneficiaries of each petition. As such, each petition should include the required list of everyone who is in the group with their names and employment start date. If any information necessary for adjudication is not provided at the time of filing, we will send a Request for Evidence."

However, a petitioning employer may request a fee waiver for Form I-129CW when petitioning for a CW-1 transitional worker or for Form I-129 when petitioning for an E-2 CNMI Investor. Because only a sole proprietor could meet the criteria for inability to pay, only a sole proprietor could request such a fee waiver."

Petitioners must also pay the $600 Asylum Program fee, although there is a reduced fee ($300) for small employers and no additional fee for nonprofits.

		"question": "Q. How does the final rule affect the fees for naturalization applications?",
		"answer": "A. We have long recognized the social and economic benefits that the United States receives from new citizens, and, to that end, prior fee rules have kept naturalization application fees below the level of full cost recovery.\nThe new fee rule is consistent with this longstanding practice, as indicated in the table below. Previously, the total cost included both an application fee ($640) and a separate biometric services fee ($85), for a total of $725 for most applicants. Under the new fee rule, there is no longer a separate biometric services fee, and the total fee is $710 for online filers or $760 for paper filers.\nThe new fee rule also provides a reduced naturalization fee ($380) for applicants with a household income at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), expanding eligibility for this reduced fee. Under the previous fee schedule, this reduced fee was only available to applicants with a household income between 150% and 200% of the FPG."

		"answer": "A. This change will allow us to reduce administrative burdens and processing errors associated with certain fee payments. Lockboxes, which specialize in intaking and depositing multiple payment types, currently receive about 53% of all USCIS filings. However, the requirements and circumstances for some filing requests do not allow lockbox submission and intake, and such requests must be filed at a particular office or in person. Various offices, such as field offices, embassies, and consulates, are limited in the method of payment that they can receive or process. Additionally, certain payment methods, such as checks or cash, require time-intensive procedures for cashiers and their supervisors to input, reconcile, and verify their daily receipts and deposits. Generally, federal agency offices must deposit money that they receive on the same day that it is received. There are additional requirements and guidance for timely record keeping and redundancy in personnel that similarly increase workload and processing costs. The time that we currently comply with certain payment processing requirements could be used to adjudicate cases."

		"question": "Q. Why does the final rule prohibit filers from getting their fees back by filing a dispute of their USCIS fee charges with their credit card company?",
		"answer": "A. The increased acceptance of credit card payments for USCIS fees has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of disputes filed with credit card companies challenging USCIS’ retention of the fee. Disputes are generally filed when the fee is due, but we denied the filer’s request, they have changed their mind about the request, or they assert that the service was not provided or was unreasonably delayed. Because credit card companies usually withdraw the fee in the case of disputes, abuse of the credit card dispute process could have negative fiscal effects on USCIS. Furthermore, though fees are generally nonrefundable, we have a process where a filer may request a fee refund in the very uncommon instance of a fee being paid or collected erroneously. Therefore, the final rule provides that fees paid to USCIS by credit card are not subject to a chargeback by the issuing financial institution and reinforces that credit card disputes cannot be used to circumvent the requirement to pay the correct fee for a benefit request."

		"question": "Q. What happened to the 2020 fee rule?",
		"answer": "A. On Aug. 3, 2020, DHS published the 2020 final fee rule, with an effective date of Oct. 2, 2020, to adjust the USCIS fee schedule and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. On Sept. 29, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion for a preliminary injunction of the 2020 fee rule in its entirety and stayed the final rule’s effective date. On Oct. 8, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date of the final rule.\nDHS subsequently issued a notification on Jan. 29, 2021, to inform the public of the two preliminary injunctions. DHS continues to comply with the terms of those orders and is not enforcing the regulatory changes set out in the 2020 fee rule. We continue to accept the fees that were in place before Oct. 2, 2020, and to follow the guidance in place before Oct. 25, 2019, to adjudicate fee waiver requests."
