Continuous residence means you must establish residence in the United States on or before the continuous residence date, and you must have continued to reside in the United States since then. Continuous physical presence means you must have been physically present in the United States continuously since the continuous physical presence date. For Venezuela’s redesignation, effective Oct. 3, 2023, you must demonstrate your continuous residence in the United States since July 31, 2023, and your continuous physical presence since Oct. 3, 2023.\nThe regulations at 8 CFR 244.1(3) define the terms as follows:\nContinuously physically present means actual physical presence in the United States for the entire period specified in the regulations. An alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and innocent absences as defined within this section.Continuously resided means residing in the United States for the entire period specified in the regulations.

		"answer": "A18. No, it is not a requirement to have entered the United States with a Venezuelan passport to be eligible for TPS under Venezuela’s designation. Additionally, in general, dual nationality alone does not make an individual ineligible for TPS. Applicants may establish that they are a national of the TPS country, irrespective of whether they are also a national of another country. If they establish that they are a national of a TPS country, then they have met the nationality requirement. Unless there is a firm resettlement bar concern, for TPS eligibility purposes, it is not material that individuals may also be a national of another country."

	{
		"question": "Q23. Who qualifies as a national of Venezuela?",
		"answer": "A23. An applicant for TPS under a particular country’s designation can establish eligibility by providing evidence of Venezuelan nationality by:\nBirth on Venezuelan soil;Filiation (being the child of Venezuelan parents); orNaturalization.\nExamples of evidence demonstrating Venezuelan nationality include a:\nPassport (current or expired);Birth certificate accompanied by photo identification; orAny national identity document from your country of origin bearing your photo and/or fingerprint issued by the applicant’s country, including documents issued by an Embassy or Consulate in the United States, such as a national ID card or naturalization certificate.\nA child born outside of Venezuela may acquire Venezuelan nationality by having a parent who is Venezuelan. However, we will determine whether a specific person meets the nationality requirement on a case-by-case basis, based on the evidence presented with their TPS application. TPS is an individual benefit, which means a child cannot be granted TPS as a derivative of a parent who receives TPS. Each person must file a separate TPS application, Form I-821, to register for TPS. Each person has the option also to apply individually for an EAD on Form I-765. Family members may submit their individual applications for TPS simultaneously or at different times. We encourage each family member to file their own application with a separate payment."

		"answer": "A24. We will look at whether any time that you spent outside of the United States since the continuous residence date of July 31, 2023, and the continuous physical presence date of Oct. 3, 2023, will cause you not to meet the eligibility requirements for continuous residence and continuous physical presence. We will also look at whether your citizenship or other permanent immigration status in a country other than Venezuela is relevant to the firm resettlement bar. We adjudicate each application on a case-by-case basis. Merely being a dual national with both Venezuelan and another citizenship does not, by itself, disqualify you from TPS. If you have citizenship or another form of permanent immigration status in a country other than Venezuela, we encourage you to provide all relevant details, including when you obtained or were offered such other citizenship or status and any times when you were in that other country before arriving in the United States. You should also include any information and supporting documentation that may help us determine whether the exceptions in 8 CFR 208.15 to the firm resettlement bar apply in your particular circumstances.\nTravel"

Individuals may request to travel to Venezuela if their TPS was approved.\nIn general, TPS applicants and beneficiaries who wish to travel outside the United States should apply for a travel authorization with  Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. We will issue a travel authorization document under TPS if we determine it is appropriate to approve the request. The travel authorization document gives you permission to leave the United States and return during a specified period of time.
